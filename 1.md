Profile Analysis & Differentiators

Short summary (no fluff): you’re a mid-career candidate with solid, recent hands-on Java/Spring skills (authored two Spring Boot projects, JWT security, Gradle, MySQL/H2, high test coverage), plus strong analytical experience (Power BI/Excel/R), process improvement in supply-chain, safety/compliance leadership, and people-management (Toastmasters, AIESEC, coaching). That combo (technical baseline + measurable domain/process experience + leadership) is precisely the package hiring teams in engineering organizations can use — if you package it correctly.

Key transferable strengths (how recruiters/hiring managers will value them):

Systemic problem solving & data-driven decisions: Excel automation + Power BI dashboards → ability to convert metrics into actionable work. Useful for data engineering, reliability, and platform roles.
Process ownership & compliance discipline: Safety officer + audits → reliability, observability, and production-runbook thinking for ops/SRE/DevOps roles.
High accountability & coaching: Skydiving coach + Toastmasters → mentoring/junior developer onboarding, code reviews, documentation, and incident postmortems.
Stakeholder management without client-facing craving: You can translate requirements across teams (business ↔ engineering) without doing sales — valuable for internal-facing roles such as TPM, platform or integration engineering.
Java/Spring foundation + testing discipline: 95% coverage + JUnit/Mockito → fast ramp into backend, API, and automation work where quality matters.
Feasible Career Paths (12 distinct non-customer-facing roles)

Below are 12 practical career paths you can realistically target using your resume + focused upskilling. For each: why it fits, the local/European market reality, age/competitive considerations and a 1-month hire-readiness plan (concrete steps, prioritized).

Leveraging Your Background: Framing & Elevator Pitches

You must stop apologizing for your past. Convert it into advantages with short, repeatable statements.

Elevator pitch templates (pick + adapt):

Backend developer pitch (30s):
“I’m a Java developer who builds reliable, well-tested backend systems. My Skydiving Logbook REST API demonstrates production-grade Spring Boot services with JWT auth and 95% test coverage. Before software engineering I led process and compliance programs — I bring operational rigor to deployment, monitoring and incident response.”

SRE / DevOps pitch (30s):
“I’m a systems-first engineer: I write the services and I own how they run. My projects include full test coverage and CI pipelines; my background in safety audits and operational ownership gives me a practical advantage in preventing incidents and documenting runbooks.”

Data Engineer pitch (30s):
“I combine SQL, Power BI and software engineering: I build pipelines, validate data, and convert findings into dashboards. My experience improving asset flows at CHEP is directly applicable to ETL pipeline reliability and data quality.”

CV bullet reframing rules (apply everywhere):

Use metrics: e.g., “95% code coverage”; “reduced deployment time — X → Y” (if you can measure).
Replace “sales/customer” language with “stakeholder alignment”, “process optimization”, “data-driven decisions”.
Add a short Technical Highlights block on top of CV: list Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Gradle, JUnit, Mockito, Docker, GitHub Actions, Power BI.
Immediate 5-Week Action Plan (week-by-week, precise)

Goal: Get first interviews and a shortlist of 3 job offers within ~2–3 months. This plan focuses on Backend/DevOps/QA/Data paths (choose 2 targets: primary + backup).

Week 1 — Stabilize & Document (Foundation)
Technical: Add Dockerfile + docker-compose to your REST API and Thymeleaf apps. Add Testcontainers to integration tests.
Documentation: Create a crisp “Project One-pager” for each project: architecture diagram, endpoints, auth, CI, tests, how to run locally.
CV/LinkedIn: Update top summary to highlight Java/Spring + 95% coverage + CI/CD + operational experience. Add “Tech Highlights” section.
Applications: Identify and apply to 10 Java/QA roles focused on Athens & remote; set daily target (10 applications/week).

Deliverables: Dockerized repo + README + updated CV.

Week 2 — CI/CD + Cloud deploy (Show deployments)
Technical: Implement GitHub Actions pipeline: build, test, coverage check, build docker image, push to Docker Hub.
Cloud: Deploy one app to a free tier (Heroku / Render / Azure App Service). Add deployment URL to README.
Interview prep: Prepare STAR stories for: incident you managed, process you improved, and a time you taught/coached. Focus on quantifiable outcomes.
Networking: Message 10 Athens-based devs on LinkedIn with a concise note showing a project and asking one specific technical question.

Deliverables: CI pipeline + public deployment + 10 LinkedIn reaches.

Week 3 — Observability & Resilience (ops signal)
Technical: Integrate Prometheus metrics + a simple Grafana dashboard (docker). Add one alert rule and a short runbook for a common failure (DB down).
Testing: Add an API contract (OpenAPI) and one contract test (Pact).
Applications: Apply to 20 more targeted roles (DevOps, QA Automation, Data Engineer). Tailor cover letters to role.
Interview practice: Do 2 mock whiteboard/system-design sessions (30–45 min).

Deliverables: Observability demo + OpenAPI + 20 applications.

Week 4 — Specialization & Portfolio polish
Choose your primary target (Backend OR DevOps OR QA): focus remaining work on that track.
If Backend: Add one microservice + message queue demo + Resilience4j.
If DevOps/SRE: Add Terraform small infra + simulate a deploy rollback.
If QA: Add Selenium suite, CI UI test runs, and test metrics artifact.
Public presence: Publish a short technical blog / GitHub README that explains your system design and reliability lessons learned (one post).

Deliverables: One track-focused demo + blog post.

Week 5 — Outreach, interviews & offers pipeline
Apply & follow up: Re-apply or follow up to your top 20 roles with a concise message: 2–3 lines on fit + link to project and deployment.
Interview preparations: 4 timed coding problems (LeetCode Easy/Medium), plus one full system-design talk for your project (10–15 minutes).
Hiring signals: Start scheduling interviews; create a “questions to ask” sheet for hiring managers focused on team size, deployment cadence, tech stack, mentorship, and career progression.

Deliverables: Follow-ups sent, interviews scheduled, interview prep checklist.

Realistic & Brutal Assessment

Likelihood of a hire quickly: High for Backend Java and QA Automation roles if you execute the above 5-week plan and apply persistently — employers value your exact stack and test discipline. DevOps/SRE/Cloud roles are reachable but require demonstrable infra work (Terraform, cloud deployments) which you can show as small projects. Data Engineering is realistic but you must add Python/ETL and Airflow proof-of-work quickly. citeturn0search4turn0search2

Age factor — be blunt: Age is not a career killer. It is a neutral factor that becomes an advantage when you present maturity, reliability, and process ownership. The risk is salary expectations and cultural fit assumptions. Tackle it by:

being transparent and realistic about compensation bands,
emphasizing coachability and willingness to learn current cloud/infra tools,
positioning yourself as a short-time-to-productivity hire (show the deployed demos and CI pipelines).
Suggested Interview / Application Checklist (exact items to include in applications)
One-line summary: “Java Spring Boot backend; JWT security; 95% test coverage; CI/CD; Docker; deployed on [platform].”
Link to GitHub repo with: Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflow, JaCoCo report, system-design.md, and deployment URL.
Short PDF (1 page) titled “Project: Skydiving Logbook — tech summary” with bullets on architecture and reliability considerations.
Two quick reference bullets from CHEP about process improvements (quantified) to show impact.
Next prompting ideas (things you should ask me next)
“Make a GitHub Actions workflow for my Spring Boot project that runs tests, fails if coverage < 80%, builds a Docker image, and pushes to Docker Hub — show the YAML.”
“Write a 1-page project summary PDF for Skydiving Logbook that I can attach to applications.”
“Mock interview: give me 10 Java backend interview questions + ideal answers and a 20-minute system-design prompt about a small logging service.”
“Create a 30-day learning checklist for transitioning specifically into Data Engineering (Python + Airflow + Spark).”

If you want I’ll now:

produce the exact GitHub Actions YAML for your Skydiving Logbook pipeline, and/or
draft the one-page technical project summary PDF content ready to convert to PDF, and/or
prepare the 5 mock LinkedIn outreach messages tailored to hiring managers in Athens.

Pick one and I’ll output it immediately.

[ASSISTANT]

Below is a battle plan (not fluff) to pivot into QA/Test Automation (SDET) and Build & Release / DevOps / SRE paths in one month, leveraging your Java/Spring Boot foundation. You’ll have something polished, portfolio-ready, and talkable by the November 6/8 career fairs.

1. Technology & Tooling Blueprint

Here I list tools/tech stacks per path, in Core → Intermediate → Nice-to-Have, with exactly how they connect to your Java/Spring Boot baseline. Also include how Bash/Python apply.

Path	Core & Immediate	Intermediate & Expanding	Nice-to-Have / Future
QA / SDET	- JUnit 5 + Mockito (you already have this) – push deeper (parameterized, nested, tagging)
- Testcontainers (for DB, message queue) with Java
- REST-assured (Java) for API-level tests
- Postman + Newman (CLI) for API testing
- Selenium WebDriver (Java bindings) for UI automation
- Maven/Gradle test orchestration (you know Gradle)
- Bash scripting (for wrapping test runs, orchestration)
- GitHub Actions (or Jenkins) running test suites	- Cucumber / BDD (Java)
- Pact (contract testing between microservices)
- Allure / ExtentReports for test reporting
- Performance testing: JMeter / Gatling (Java)
- Python (for test utilities, data-driven tests, helper scripts)
- Parallel test execution, container orchestration	- AI-driven test generation tools (e.g., Testim, Applitools)
- Mobile automation: Appium (Java)
- Security testing: OWASP ZAP, Burp (via scripting)
- Self-healing test flows
Build & Release / DevOps / SRE	- Docker (multi-stage builds) – containerize your Spring Boot app
- Bash scripting (deploy scripts, health-check, rollback scripts)
- Git + GitHub Actions (CI flows)
- Linux (you have base familiarity)
- Basic Infrastructure-as-Code: Terraform (or AWS CloudFormation)
- Logging & metrics stack: Prometheus client (Java), Micrometer, Grafana
- Health checks / readiness probes (Spring Boot actuators)	- Kubernetes (manifest files, helm charts)
- Jenkins (if some environments still use it)
- Terraform modules, multi-environment infra
- AWS services: EC2, ECS, EKS, IAM, S3, RDS
- Python scripting (for infra tasks, orchestration)
- Monitoring / alerting: Alertmanager, Grafana alerts
- Chaos/Resilience frameworks (Chaos Monkey, Litmus)	- Service mesh: Istio / Linkerd
- Auto-scaling, advanced autoscaling policies
- Observability stack: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger (distributed tracing)
- Kubernetes operator development
- GitOps tools (Argo CD, Flux)

Integration of each with your Java/Spring Boot stack (examples):

Testcontainers: Use with JUnit to spin up MySQL, Kafka, or Redis in test containers so your spring boot integration tests are realistic.
REST-assured: call your Spring Boot endpoints in automated test suites.
Selenium WebDriver (Java): drive UI flows of your Thymeleaf frontend (login, jump creation).
Micrometer + Prometheus client: instrument your Spring Boot service to expose /actuator/metrics and scrape.
Docker: package your Spring Boot app into containers; multi-stage build reduces size.
Kubernetes / Helm: deploy your app container into a k8s cluster (local or cloud).
Terraform: define cloud infra (VPC, EC2, RDS) that your Spring Boot app will run on.

Role of Bash & Python:

Bash: wrapper scripts (build, run tests, cleanup, health-check), deployment scripts, cron tasks.
Python: lightweight scripts for test-data generation, infrastructure orchestration glue, parsing logs, customizing test frameworks.
2. Portfolio Project Strategy (using “Skydiving Logbook REST API” as core)
QA / SDET Path

You already have unit & integration tests at 95%. The goal is to expand and polish to industry-grade SDET level.

Enhancements to existing project

API Automation Suite (REST-level):

Use REST-assured (Java) to write tests for all endpoints (happy paths + edge cases + error scenarios).
Add data-driven testing (e.g. feed JSON payload variants via parameterized tests or external CSV/JSON).
Use Postman collections with environment variables + write Newman CLI scripts to run the collection in CI.
Add contract tests (optional) using Pact between service and client.

UI Automation Suite (Selenium):

Build UI automation for your Thymeleaf app: login, dashboard, jump creation, editing, deletion.
Use Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and wrap tests with JUnit.
Integrate UI tests into your CI/CD pipeline (headless mode).
Add retry logic or robustness (e.g., wait conditions, explicit waits).

End-to-End / Full-stack flows:

Combine UI + API tests (e.g. UI triggers API, validate via API backend).
Write cross-cutting tests (user creation → login → jump → fetch jumps).

Reporting & Metrics:

Integrate Allure / ExtentReports to generate HTML test reports.
Add code that collects test metrics (counts, pass/fail, durations) and publish metrics.

Negative / Fault Injection Tests:

Simulate DB failure (kill testcontainers DB), see how app behaves.
Insert invalid payloads, malformed JSON, missing headers.
Additional QA mini-project ideas (optional extras)
Todo-List Web App (Java + React or Thymeleaf): build small CRUD app, then create full test suites (API + UI) as a separate demonstration.
Public API Testing: pick a public REST API (e.g., GitHub, JSONPlaceholder), build your own test harness with REST-assured, simulate rate limiting, invalid requests, concurrency.
Mock Service & Contract Testing: build two microservices (producer/consumer) and create a contract test suite with Pact to validate interactions.

You should always refer back to the same stack: Java + your test tools, not completely new languages or frameworks.

DevOps / SRE / Build & Release Path

Here’s a step-by-step “DevOps-ification” roadmap of your Skydiving Logbook REST API:

Step-by-step project plan

Dockerize the app

Write a multi-stage Dockerfile:
First stage: compile/build with Gradle → produce jar.
Second stage: run with an OpenJDK slim base and copy jar.
Ensure the container exposes proper ports and health check endpoints (e.g. /actuator/health).

Local Docker Compose environment

Compose file with:
Your Spring Boot service container.
MySQL (or MariaDB) container.
Optionally Redis or a message queue stub.
Prometheus + Grafana as sidecar services.
Configure network and environment variables.

CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Workflow steps:
checkout code
build & test (unit + integration)
code coverage check (fail if < threshold)
build Docker image and tag (e.g., ghcr.io/yourname/skydivelog:latest)
push to container registry (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry)
deploy to a staging environment (docker-compose remote server or cloud).
(Optional) run smoke tests / health-checks post-deploy.
Use secret management (GitHub secrets for registry credentials).

Deploy to cloud (AWS free-tier)

Use EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk or ECS:
Option A: Use EC2 + SSH to deploy Docker Compose cluster.
Option B: Use ECS Fargate (serverless containers) or Elastic Beanstalk (Java + Docker).
Provision minimal networking (VPC, subnets), security groups, IAM roles.
Use Terraform (or AWS CDK) to codify infrastructure:
Create resources: VPC, Internet Gateway, EC2 / ECS, RDS, security groups.
Hook deployments so that pipeline triggers infra changes (Terraform apply) then deploy.

Monitoring, Logging, and Alerts

Add Micrometer instrumentation in your Spring Boot app.
Scrape /actuator/prometheus with Prometheus.
Create Grafana dashboards (request rates, error rates, response times).
Setup alerting rules (e.g. if error rate > X%).
Create simple runbooks (if service goes down, steps to restart, logs to check).

Resilience & Rollback

Implement health probes and readiness endpoints.
Add rollback path in your pipeline (keep previous version image & config).
Simulate failure (turn off DB container) and see system behavior.
Additional DevOps mini-project ideas (optional extras)
Infrastructure for microservices: take another small Java microservice and integrate into your infrastructure pipeline.
GitOps demo: use Argo CD or Flux to deploy your services from git to cluster.
Blue/Green or Canary deploy: simulate staged rollout of new version.
3. Job Search & Keyword Optimization
Job Titles to search

QA / SDET path:

Junior QA Automation Engineer
QA Automation Engineer (Java)
SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test)
Test Automation Engineer (Java)
API Test Engineer

Build & Release / DevOps / SRE path:

Build & Release Engineer
CI/CD Engineer
DevOps Engineer (Junior / Associate)
Site Reliability Engineer (Entry / Junior)
Infrastructure Engineer
Platform Engineer (DevOps tools)

In Greek job boards or English filters add tags like “Java”, “Automation”, “CI/CD”, “DevOps”, “SRE”.

Keywords / Skills for ATS & visibility

For QA / SDET:

Java, JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers, REST-assured, Postman, Newman, Selenium WebDriver (Java), Cucumber, BDD, API testing, contract testing (Pact), Allure / test reporting, CI/CD pipeline, GitHub Actions, coverage, E2E test, integration test, negative testing, automation framework, data-driven testing, reliability, code quality.

For Build & Release / DevOps / SRE:

Docker, multi-stage Dockerfile, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Prometheus, Grafana, Micrometer, Spring Boot Actuator, health checks, logging, monitoring, infrastructure as code, AWS (EC2, ECS), Linux, Bash scripting, Python, container registry, rollback strategy, scaling, reliability, observability, pipeline, automation.

Also include soft/qualifier phrases like “high test coverage,” “deployable pipeline,” “instrumentation/metrics,” “zero-downtime deployments,” “fault tolerance,” “GitOps,” “infrastructure as code (IaC)”.

Include these keywords naturally in your summary, skills section, and project descriptions.

4. Rebranding & Presentation Overhaul
Resume Rebranding (how to reframe non-technical experience)
Replace “Sales / Customer Service / Account Management” language with “Stakeholder Liaison,” “Process Optimization,” “Data-Driven Decision Making,” “Cross-Functional Communication.”
Emphasize process ownership, quality, compliance, root-cause analysis from your CHEP role — these map well to reliability & automation.
Use quantitative results even from non-tech roles (e.g., “reduced asset leakage by X%, improved utilization by Y%”) as evidence of outcome-focus.
Add a Technical Highlights or Core Competencies section at top: list Java, Spring Boot, Docker, CI/CD, Test Automation, Infrastructure, Linux, Bash, Terraform, etc.
Under each project or role, include 1–2 bullets tying to your target paths. E.g. in CHEP: “Developed automated Excel tools and dashboards, enabling data-driven interventions — analogous to building monitoring/alert dashboards.”
LinkedIn & GitHub Transformation

LinkedIn Headlines (three options):

“Java / QA Automation Engineer | DevOps & CI/CD Enthusiast”
“Aspiring SDET & DevOps Engineer | Java | Automation, Pipeline, Infrastructure”
“Backend Automation & Reliability Engineer | Spring Boot, CI/CD, Docker”

LinkedIn Summary (rewritten draft):

Results-driven software engineer in transition, combining a robust Java/Spring Boot foundation with deep experience in process optimization, data analytics, and operational rigor. I’m building a modern technical stack: REST APIs, test automation, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and system observability.

My flagship project, Skydiving Logbook, showcases a full end-to-end system with 95% test coverage, JWT-based security, and evolving infrastructure and test automation.

In my previous decade at CHEP, I led process improvements, compliance audits, and data-driven decision-making — skills I carry forward into software delivery rigor.

I’m actively seeking roles in QA Automation / SDET or DevOps / Build & Release / SRE, where reliability, automation and code quality are at the center. Let’s talk about how I can bring both engineering discipline and operational mindset to your team.

GitHub Profile / README / Pinned Repos Strategy

In your GitHub profile README, include a brief “About Me” + section “Highlights” with QA & DevOps competencies. E.g.:

👨‍💻 Java + Spring Boot | ✅ Test Automation | 🐳 Docker | ⚙️ CI/CD Pipelines | 📈 Monitoring & Infrastructure

Pin the following repos (top 3–4):

Skydiving Logbook REST API (enhanced with test suites & automation)
DevOps version of Logbook (Docker + CI/CD + monitoring)
Optional QA micro-project (test harness)
Optional infra / tool (Terraform + automation scripts)

Each repo’s README should have:

Clear description of what it does
Architecture diagram / flow
“Getting Started” steps (run locally, run tests, deploy)
Screenshots or dashboards (for metrics, UI tests)
Link to live deployment (if hosted)

In repo README summary near top, call out key capabilities: e.g. “Includes REST-assured test suite, Selenium UI tests, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Docker images, Prometheus metrics.” This helps recruiters scanning.

I am not going to use the Thymeleaf app, this is going to be archived, do not mention it again.

I am only going to use the REST APi app with the frontend.

Re-write the full and detailed battle plan, without mentioning the Thymeleaf project and only focusing on the Skydive Logbook REST API

Think hard about this

[ASSISTANT]

Understood — from now on, I’ll completely exclude any mention of the Thymeleaf app.
All planning, pipelines, testing, and project architecture will revolve exclusively around your Spring Boot REST API and its separate frontend (which consumes the API

[ASSISTANT]

Understood. We will drop the Thymeleaf app entirely and focus solely on Skydiving Logbook REST API and its frontend, building it out as a backend + API + deployment + test/automation/DevOps showcase. Below is your refined, detailed battle plan (QA/SDET + DevOps/SRE) centered on your REST API project.

1. Technology & Tooling Blueprint (focused on REST API stack)

Here’s the tooling stack, organized by path, with explicit connections to your REST API project.

QA / SDET Path
Tier	Technologies / Tools	Purpose & Integration with REST API
Core & Immediate	• JUnit 5 + Mockito (you already use this)
• Testcontainers (MySQL, Redis, Kafka)
• REST-assured (Java)
• Postman + Newman
• Selenium WebDriver (Java)
• Bash scripting
• GitHub Actions (CI)	Use Testcontainers to run real DB dependencies during tests. REST-assured calls your API endpoints. Postman/Newman offers alternate test runner. Selenium simulates UI interactions (if you still have a frontend). Bash wraps test suites. GitHub Actions automates test execution.
Intermediate & Expanding	• Cucumber / BDD (Java)
• Pact (contract testing)
• Allure / ExtentReports
• Performance testing (JMeter, Gatling)
• Python scripting for test utilities / data generation	Use BDD to express user journeys (e.g. “Given user, when create jump, then response code 201”). Pact could test contracts between frontend & API or between microservices. Performance tools test endpoints under load. Python helps build fixtures or data parameterization.
Nice-to-Have / Future	• Security testing (OWASP ZAP, Burp)
• Mobile API testing frameworks
• AI-assisted test generation tools
• Self-healing test flows	Use OWASP ZAP to scan your API endpoints. AI or self-healing flows are future polish.
DevOps / Build & Release / SRE Path
Tier	Technologies / Tools	Purpose & Integration with REST API
Core & Immediate	• Docker (multi-stage build)
• Bash scripting (deploy/health-check)
• GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
• Infrastructure-as-Code: Terraform (or AWS CloudFormation)
• Micrometer + Spring Boot Actuator
• Prometheus + Grafana
• Logging (SLF4J / Logback / Logback configuration)	Containerize your REST API; use GitHub Actions to build/test/deploy; instrument your API; collect metrics; create dashboards. Terraform codifies cloud resources. Bash wraps deploy tasks.
Intermediate & Expanding	• Kubernetes (deployment manifests, Helm)
• Jenkins (if required)
• AWS services: EC2, ECS/EKS, IAM, RDS, S3
• Python scripting for infrastructure tasks
• Alerting & notifications (Alertmanager, Grafana alerts)
• Chaos / failure simulation frameworks	Deploy your container in k8s or ECS. Use alert rules to notify when error rate high. Automate infrastructure via Python scripts. Simulate failures and observe behavior.
Nice-to-Have / Future	• Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)
• OpenTelemetry / distributed tracing (Jaeger)
• Auto-scaling policies
• GitOps (Argo CD, Flux)
• Operator development	Add tracing to your API calls, integrate into mesh, auto-scale deployments, manage deploys via GitOps.

Roles of Bash & Python (focused):

Bash: deployment scripts (pull new image, stop/start), backup, health-check loops, logging rotation, cleanup tasks.
Python: data fixture generation, API payload manipulations, infra orchestration (wrapping Terraform, AWS CLI), log parsing and analytics, API smoke tests.
2. Portfolio Project Strategy (REST API focus)

With only REST API + frontend (JS/HTML) in play, all project work will build on that.

QA / SDET Path — enhancements to REST API project

Comprehensive Test Suite Expansion

Unit & Integration Tests (deeper):
Cover edge cases, nulls, invalid JSON, boundary conditions.
Use parameterized tests, nested test classes, tag categories.
Use Testcontainers for real dependencies:
Use a MySQL container or even multiple containers for integration tests.
REST-assured API tests:
Write tests in Java calling all endpoints (CRUD, search, stats) with valid & invalid inputs.
Use data-driven approach (CSV or JSON inputs).
Negative / Fault Tests:
Send malformed JSON, missing auth, invalid IDs, date ranges invalid.
Simulate DB down (e.g. kill container) and test behavior.

Postman / Newman Integration

Build a Postman collection for all endpoints (with environments).
Include pre-request scripts, test assertions.
Use Newman CLI to run collection from command-line.
Add automation in CI to run Newman tests.

UI (Frontend) Automation (if a minimal frontend remains)

If frontend exists, automate flows (login, fetch jumps, create jump).
Page Object Model, explicit waits, retry logic.
Integrate UI tests into CI.

Test Reporting & CI Integration

Use Allure or ExtentReports to generate nice HTML reports for test runs (unit + API + UI).
In GitHub Actions, generate and publish test artifacts (reports) or host via GitHub Pages.
Aggregate coverage, test durations, pass/fail summary.

Contracts / Consumer-driven test (optional but impressive)

If you envision a frontend or another service consuming your API, you could define contracts with Pact and verify expectations.

Resilience / Chaos Testing

Simulate latency or DB unavailability and assert how API behaves (timeouts, error codes).
Use test code to inject delays or faults (e.g., via testcontainers network rules).
Additional QA mini-projects (optional)
A “Task Manager API” (simple CRUD) and full test suite (API + performance + contract).
Public REST API (e.g. GitHub API) — write a test harness checking endpoints, rate limits, pagination.

All of these should use Java + your tools so you don’t stray from your core stack.

DevOps / Build & Release / SRE Path — “DevOps-ify” your REST API project
Step-by-step enhancement plan

Multi-stage Dockerfile

Stage 1: build with ./gradlew build → produce fat JAR.
Stage 2: use openjdk:slim or alpine to run.
Include health-check endpoints in Docker instructions (e.g., HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1).

docker-compose local stack

Compose file with: API service + MySQL container + Prometheus + Grafana.
Set up network, environment variables, mounting if needed.
Expose metrics endpoint, link it to Prometheus.

CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

Steps:
checkout
build + test
run REST-assured / integration tests
code coverage gating
build Docker image, tag with commit SHA
push to container registry
deploy to staging (via SSH, or cloud)
run smoke tests / health-check endpoints
rollback logic if health-check fails
Securely store registry credentials, SSH keys, secrets.

Cloud Deployment (AWS free-tier or equivalent)

Choose path: ECS, EC2 + Docker Compose, or Elastic Beanstalk with Docker.
Use Terraform to define:
VPC, subnets, security groups
EC2 / ECS cluster
LoadBalancer (optional)
RDS (MySQL)
Automate the deployment sequence: apply infra, deploy container, health-check.

Monitoring, Logging, Alerts

Instrument your API with Micrometer and expose metrics via Spring Boot Actuator.
Use Prometheus (scrape metrics) + Grafana dashboards (latency, request count, error ratio).
Define alert rules (e.g. HTTP 5xx > threshold).
Build dashboards and embed graphs/screenshots in your portfolio.

Resilience & Rollback

Implement readiness/liveness endpoints.
Pipeline keeps previous container/config; if deploy fails health-check, rollback automatically.
Simulate failures (DB down) and recover. Document runbook.

Optional advanced: Kubernetes / Helm

Write k8s manifests (Deployment, Service) or a basic Helm chart.
Optionally deploy into a free-tier k8s environment (e.g. GKE / EKS free tier).
Use GitOps (ArgoCD) to deploy from your GitHub repo.
Additional DevOps mini-project ideas
A second microservice (e.g. a “Statistics” service) that fetches jump data and you deploy alongside your API.
A GitHub Action custom plugin or tool for versioning, promoting builds.
Infrastructure for scaling / autoscaling demonstration (simulate load).
3. Job Search & Keyword Optimization (REST-API-focused only)
Target Job Titles

4. Rebranding & Presentation Overhaul (REST API focus)
Resume Rebranding
Drop any mention of the Thymeleaf / UI project— focus entirely on your REST API + automation + deployment work.
Reframe your past roles thus:
“Developed data-driven dashboards and automated analytics tools, enabling operational insight and root-cause resolution — skills transferable to monitoring and alert systems.”
“Led compliance audits and process standardization — translates to building sober reliability practices, runbooks, SLAs in software delivery.”
Emphasize system thinking, process, quality, operational accountability.
Top section: Technical Summary / Core Skills: Java, Spring Boot, REST API, JUnit, Testcontainers, Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Prometheus.
Under your project section, add bullets like:
“Built REST API with 95% test coverage, automated CI pipeline, Docker containerization, instrumentation and monitoring.”
“Expanded test suite with REST-assured and Postman/Newman integration, and failure-scenario tests.”
LinkedIn Headlines (focusing on REST API + target paths)
“Java / QA Automation & DevOps Engineer | REST API, CI/CD, Observability”
“REST API Automation & DevOps (SDET + DevOps) | Java, Docker, Terraform, Monitoring”
“Backend Automation & Reliability Engineer | Spring Boot, Automation, Deployment”
LinkedIn Summary (revised)

If you like, I can now map out which resources you should consume weekly (schedule) from these three lists tailored to your 5-week sprint, so you don't get overwhelmed and follow the right path. Do you want me to do that next?

[ASSISTANT]

Below are three prioritized, ready-to-run lists (Books, Free Courses, Online Resources) tuned strictly for your one-month sprint toward QA/SDET + DevOps (Java / Spring Boot / Gradle or Maven / REST API) work. Each item includes a direct link and one clear sentence explaining why it’s top-priority for your goals.

I audited and prioritized these for immediate applicability to: Java + Spring Boot REST API testing, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, containerization (Docker), test automation (JUnit/Mockito/REST-assured/Selenium), and infra IaC/tools (Terraform, Kubernetes). The courses are free to access (YouTube, Test Automation University, official docs/tutorials, HashiCorp Learn, etc.). For quick reference, the five most load-bearing sources I used to validate the lists (TAU, Docker, GitHub Actions, Spring Guides, REST-assured) are cited here. citeturn14search16turn19search1turn18search4turn9search0turn14search24

Quick usage tips (one-line each)
Use Test Automation University (REST-assured + JUnit5) first to create a runnable API test suite for Skydiving Logbook (hours → tangible PR). citeturn14search1turn14search2
Use Docker official "Get Started" to create a multi-stage Dockerfile and Docker Compose for the app, then plug that into a GitHub Actions workflow to build & push images. citeturn19search1turn18search7
Add Testcontainers to CI to run your MySQL tests reliably (major interview + hiring win). citeturn7search0

If you want, I’ll now:

Turn this into a day-by-day 4-week learning calendar that assigns specific videos/chapters from the lists to each day and ties them to specific GitHub PRs for Skydiving Logbook (fastest route to career-fair readiness), or
Generate the exact GitHub Actions workflow YAML + Dockerfile + Testcontainers JUnit5 example code you can directly paste into your repo to demonstrate CI, test, and containerization.

Pick one and I’ll generate it immediately.
