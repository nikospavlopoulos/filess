Leveraging Existing Background

Frame your past as an asset: Your sales/CS experience taught real-world problem-solving and stakeholder alignment, rare in pure tech grads. Strategies:

Resume Framing: Lead with tech projects, then "Professional Experience" as "Applied Analytics & Optimization" – e.g., "Developed data tools reducing asset losses by X%."
Networking: Use LinkedIn to connect with mid-career tech pros; share posts on how compliance skills enhance secure coding.
Elevator Pitch Snippets: "My 15+ years optimizing supply chains with data analytics give me a unique edge in backend development—I build systems that solve business problems, not just code." Or: "As a former safety officer, I ensure robust testing; my leadership in global orgs means I mentor teams effectively."

This isn't fluff—it's factual repositioning, but if overdone, it risks seeming defensive.

Immediate Action Plan

Week-by-week for 5 weeks, focusing on top 3 roles (Backend, Data Eng, QA Automation) for efficiency. Dedicate 15-20 hours/week; track progress.

Week 1: Assessment & Foundation: Review your GitHub; update resume with transferable framing. Complete free Coursera "Java Advanced" module. Build basic Docker container for your API project. Apply to 5 entry Backend roles on LinkedIn/Glassdoor.
Week 2: Skill Building: Learn Spark/Airflow (Data Eng focus); create ETL prototype from your R data. Enhance LinkedIn profile with tech keywords; join Greek tech groups (e.g., Hellenic Startup Association).
Week 3: Portfolio Enhancement: Add Selenium tests to your app (QA focus). Draft 3 elevator pitches; record a 1-min video demo for LinkedIn. Apply to 10 roles (mix Data/DevOps).
Week 4: Rebranding & Networking: Earn AWS free cert (DevOps). Update personal site with new projects. Attend 1 virtual meetup (e.g., Athens Java User Group); send 10 connection requests with personalized notes.
Week 5: Application Push: Simulate interviews (LeetCode easy problems). Apply to 15+ roles; follow up on prior apps. Refine based on feedback.

This plan is aggressive—expect rejections due to competition, but it's achievable for paychecks in 2-3 months if consistent.

What specific role from the ten intrigues you most, and why? How recent is your networking in Greek tech circles? Any constraints like location or salary minimums I should factor in?

Technology & Tooling Blueprint

For both paths, prioritize tools that build on your Java/Spring Boot foundation. Your existing API project provides a perfect integration point—use it for hands-on practice. Bash scripting applies to automating deployments and CI/CD scripts; Python for utility scripts in testing frameworks or infrastructure monitoring. Categorize by urgency, with Core & Immediate focusing on 1-month essentials.

QA/Test Automation/SDET Path

Core & Immediate:

Selenium WebDriver with Java bindings: Integrate to automate UI tests for your Spring Boot app's HTML/JS frontend, extending your JUnit/Mockito setup for end-to-end (E2E) browser interactions.
Postman/Newman: Use for API testing your Spring Boot REST endpoints; script collections in JavaScript, then automate via Bash for CI integration.
Cucumber with Java: Add behavior-driven development (BDD) layers to your existing JUnit tests, defining scenarios for your API's user authentication and jump logging.
Bash scripting: Write scripts to run automated test suites locally or in CI, e.g., chaining JUnit with Selenium for headless testing on Linux.
Python: Develop utility scripts for test data generation or parsing logs from your Spring Boot app during integration tests.

Intermediate & Expanding:

TestNG: Replace or complement JUnit for parallel testing of your Spring Boot services, integrating with Mockito for mocked dependencies.
Appium with Java: Extend to mobile testing if your app evolves; link to your backend by automating API calls from simulated devices.
REST Assured: Java library for API validation; integrate directly with your Spring Boot tests to assert JWT security and response schemas.
Python (expanded): Use pytest framework for supplementary scripts testing non-Java components, like database interactions via SQL connectors.

Nice-to-Have & Future:

Cypress: JS-based for modern E2E; integrate via API calls to your Spring Boot backend for hybrid testing.
JMeter: For performance testing your API; script in Java to load-test endpoints.
Ansible: Automate test environment setup with Bash/Python playbooks, provisioning Linux VMs for reproducible Spring Boot deploys.
Build & Release/DevOps/CI-CD/SRE Path

Core & Immediate:

Docker: Containerize your Spring Boot app using Java-compatible images; write multi-stage Dockerfiles to build Gradle artifacts.
GitHub Actions: Set up workflows in YAML, triggered by Java code pushes; integrate Bash scripts for building and testing your app.
Jenkins: Pipeline as code in Groovy/Java; link to your Gradle builds for CI/CD, running JUnit tests automatically.
Bash scripting: Create deployment scripts for your Linux setup, e.g., automating container spins and MySQL connections for your app.
Python: Write scripts for monitoring app health post-deploy, using libraries like requests to ping your REST API.

Intermediate & Expanding:

Kubernetes (kubectl/minikube): Deploy your Dockerized Spring Boot app to pods; use Java clients for custom operators if needed.
Terraform: Infrastructure as code (IaC) in HCL; provision AWS resources for hosting your app, callable from Bash/Python wrappers.
AWS CLI/EC2: Manage free-tier instances for your app; integrate with Spring Boot via SDK for cloud configs.
Python (expanded): Use for IaC utilities like Boto3 to automate AWS tasks, complementing your Java backend.

Nice-to-Have & Future:

Prometheus/Grafana: Monitor your Spring Boot metrics; export via Java actuators and query with Python scripts.
Ansible: Orchestrate multi-environment deploys for your app, using Bash for custom modules.
GitLab CI: Alternative to GitHub Actions; define pipelines in YAML with Java integration for artifact management.

Portfolio Project Strategy

Leverage your Skydiving Logbook REST API as the core—it's already strong with 95% coverage, but expanding it demonstrates depth without starting from scratch. Additional projects must tie back to it for cohesion.

QA/SDET Path

Adapting Existing "Skydiving Logbook REST API":

Enhance test suite: Build on JUnit/Mockito by adding integration tests for edge cases (e.g., invalid JWTs) aiming for 98%+ coverage with JaCoCo; include E2E tests simulating full user flows.
Add API automation: Create Postman collections for all endpoints (auth, jumps, lookups); export as Newman scripts runnable via Bash, integrating assertions for response codes and data integrity.
Implement UI automation: Use Selenium Java to script browser tests for frontend forms (login, dashboard); integrate with your Spring Boot backend by automating API-frontend interactions, e.g., validating jump creation end-to-end.
Document in README: Add sections on test architecture, including Cucumber feature files for BDD scenarios like "User logs jump with invalid date."

Additional Smaller Projects (Expanding the Existing API):

API Load Testing Extension: Fork your repo; add JMeter scripts (Java-based) to stress-test endpoints, generating reports on throughput—link back by using your app's data models.
Mobile Test Harness: Simulate a simple Android wrapper consuming your API; automate with Appium Java, focusing on authentication flows tied to your JWT security.
Data Validation Utility: Python script to generate test datasets for your MySQL; integrate via Bash to seed DB before running expanded JUnit suites on your app.
DevOps/SRE Path

Step-by-Step to "DevOps-ify" the "Skydiving Logbook REST API":

Containerize: Write a multi-stage Dockerfile—stage 1 builds your Gradle app, stage 2 runs the JAR in a slim Java image; include MySQL as a sidecar.
Set up CI/CD: In GitHub Actions, create a workflow YAML: On push, run JUnit tests, build Docker image, push to Docker Hub; use Bash steps for linting.
Alternative Jenkins: Install locally on Linux; define a pipeline script to mirror above, integrating with your Gradle for artifact promotion.
Local Deploy: Use docker-compose.yml to spin up app + MySQL; add health checks via Python script monitoring ports.
Live Deploy: Sign up AWS free tier; use Terraform to provision EC2; deploy Docker image via ECS or EC2 instance, exposing API publicly with security groups.
Update README: Add DevOps section with pipeline diagrams, deployment scripts, and monitoring setup.

Additional Smaller Projects (Expanding the Existing API):

IaC for Staging Env: Use Terraform to create a duplicate AWS setup for your app; include Bash scripts for blue-green deploys.
Monitoring Dashboard: Integrate Prometheus into your Dockerized app (via Spring actuators); build Grafana dashboards, with Python scripts for alert testing.
Automated Backup Pipeline: Extend GitHub Actions with a job for DB backups using Bash/Python, triggered nightly on your MySQL container.

Job Search & Keyword Optimization

Target junior/associate levels; Greece has moderate demand (75+ QA, 200+ DevOps jobs), but Europe-wide expands options—focus on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed Greece. Your age and non-tech background may flag ATS, so overload keywords naturally.
