[USER]

[ASSISTANT]

Nikos, I'm "TechCareer Catalyst." Your profile shows a decisive, high-stakes shift from a highly customer-facing past to a technical future. This is a common and achievable transition, but the market demands ruthless focus. Your desire to avoid all sales and customer service roles is clear and is the primary filter for this analysis.

Your background is not a disadvantage; it's a unique differentiator, but you must stop listing every job you've ever had. Trim the resume to highlight the last 10-12 years and focus the bullets on process, data, and measurable outcomes, not relationship building.

1. Profile Analysis & Differentiators

Your profile presents a strong foundation for a mid-career pivot, leveraging maturity and business acumen alongside a fresh, focused technical certificate. Your differentiators are as follows:

Process & Risk Management (Safety Compliance, B2B Management): The IOSH certification and experience in biennial safety compliance audits at CHEP demonstrate a structured, detail-oriented, and process-driven mindset. This is highly valuable in QA, DevOps, and Security roles, which are fundamentally about establishing and enforcing robust processes and minimizing risk.

Data-Driven Problem Solving (Power BI/Excel Automation): Developing automated tools and dashboards to identify and locate equipment misuse is the most compelling bullet point on your resume. This shows practical application of data analysis (Power BI, Excel) to solve a complex, costly business problem. This directly translates to success in Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and Business Intelligence roles, where Java/Spring skills provide a technical edge over pure analysts.

Structured Communication & Leadership (Toastmasters/AIESEC): Leading Toastmasters and AIESEC (Trainer, President) proves highly developed structured communication, technical presentation, and training skills. These are rare in entry-level pure developers and are critical for Technical Writer, Program Manager, or Scrum Master roles. This mitigates the risk of being a "non-technical" hire, as you're clearly capable of articulating complex information.

Proven Professional Track Record (Awards, Tenure): Your long tenure and performance awards at CHEP (top performer 2017, solving data accuracy issues 2022) signal reliability, commitment, and a strong work ethic. For a hiring manager considering a 40-year-old career changer, this addresses the primary concern: Will this person commit to the new path, or revert to what they know? Your history suggests commitment.

2. Feasible Career Paths Analysis (Non-Customer-Facing)

3. Leveraging Existing Background

Your past is your moat against younger competitors, but only if you reframe it completely.

Strategic Re-Framing Principles

Shift from What I Did to What I Solved: Stop describing sales activities. Describe the processes you optimized, the data you utilized, and the financial impact of your analysis.

Translate Business Acumen to Technical Value: Your domain expertise in supply chain and asset management (CHEP) is highly valuable for companies in Logistics, Fintech, or B2B SaaS. You understand the problem the software is solving, which junior developers rarely do.

Use Process and Analysis Vocabulary: Use terms like root cause analysis (instead of finding misuse), system optimization (instead of increasing utilization), and stakeholder management (instead of relationship building).

"Elevator Pitch" Snippets

For a QA/DevOps Role:

"My previous role was fundamentally about risk mitigation and compliance enforcement. As a certified Safety Officer and asset manager, I successfully audited complex processes and enforced protocol, achieving top regional ratings. I am now applying that same detail-oriented, process-first mindset to QA Automation and DevOps, where building quality and reliable pipelines is the core objective. My Java/JUnit skills allow me to write code that ensures system integrity, not just manage paper compliance."

For a Data Engineering/Business Intelligence Role:

"My 8 years at CHEP gave me deep, practical experience in using data to drive substantial business outcomes—specifically, developing automated Power BI and Excel solutions to identify and correct millions in asset leakage. I don't just know SQL; I understand why the data structure matters for the P&L. I am transitioning into Data Engineering to build robust, scalable pipelines using Java/Spring that solve complex supply chain problems, moving beyond desktop tools to enterprise-level architecture."

For a TPM/Scrum Master Role:

"The key to managing key B2B relationships and leading an international club (Toastmasters President) is structured, high-impact communication and process facilitation. I bring a decade of proven professional maturity and project management coursework to the table. I'm not a pure coder, but my AUEB Certificate gives me the technical fluency to communicate credibly with developers, ensuring clear requirements, mitigating scope creep, and focusing the team on business outcomes."

This roadmap is a surgical plan designed to transition your profile from a risk management/sales background to a high-demand technical specialist in QA Automation (SDET) and DevOps/SRE within a 3-month employment window. The 1-month sprint focuses on creating irrefutable, integrated technical proof points that leverage your Java/Spring Boot foundation.

1. Technology & Tooling Blueprint

Your strength is the Java/Spring Boot stack; every new tool must integrate with it to maximize efficiency and credibility. We use Bash and Python strategically as supporting, not core, languages.

Path

Category

Technology/Tool

Java/Spring Boot Integration

Bash/Python Application

QA / SDET

Core & Immediate

Selenium WebDriver (Java)

Use the Java client libraries and JUnit 5/TestNG to write robust End-to-End (E2E) tests for your existing Skydiving Web App. This is the main portfolio piece.

Bash: Use simple scripts (test.sh) to execute the Java test suite via Gradle/Maven CLI. Python: Use for simple data generation or validation tasks outside the test framework.

RestAssured (Java)

A Java library designed specifically for testing REST APIs. Use it to build an API Test Suite for your Spring Boot REST API, testing authentication, CRUD, and error handling.

N/A

JUnit 5 / TestNG

Already strong in JUnit. Focus on advanced features like Parametrized Tests and Test Suites to organize E2E/API tests clearly.

N/A

Intermediate & Expanding

Cucumber/Gherkin

Use the Java bindings to implement a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework. This appeals to recruiters looking for candidates with strong business-to-technical communication skills (your Toastmasters background).

N/A

DevOps / SRE

Core & Immediate

Docker

Create a multi-stage Dockerfile to build the Spring Boot .jar file and then package it efficiently with a JRE base image. Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the application and its MySQL database.

Bash: Crucial. Write your deploy.sh and start.sh scripts to manage environment variables, pull images, and run the service stack using Docker Compose.

GitHub Actions

Create a CI/CD pipeline using the Java/Gradle builder action. The pipeline must automatically trigger, run all JUnit/RestAssured tests, build the Docker image, and push it to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

Bash: Commands like docker login, docker build, and docker push are executed via Bash commands within the YAML workflow steps.

Intermediate & Expanding

Terraform

Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Use HCL to provision a simple AWS Free Tier EC2 instance for your application. This demonstrates core infrastructure skills.

Python (Boto3): While Terraform is the priority, Python's Boto3 library can be used for custom cloud automation scripts.

Prometheus/Grafana

Monitoring. Add Micrometer dependency to your Spring Boot app to expose application metrics, then configure Prometheus/Grafana (run via Docker Compose) to scrape and visualize them.

N/A

Export to Sheets

2. Portfolio Project Strategy

The "Skydiving Logbook REST API" is your single most important asset. It must be transformed from a coding certificate artifact into a production-ready demonstration of QA/SDET and DevOps competency.

QA / SDET Path: Project Adaptation

The goal is a T-shaped testing pyramid where you show mastery over Unit/Integration (already 95%) and API/E2E.

API Automation (RestAssured):

Action: Create a new folder (/automation/api-tests) within your Skydiving repo.

Implementation: Use RestAssured (Java) to create dedicated test classes that hit the /api/auth/login endpoint, extract the JWT, and use that token to perform full CRUD cycles on the /api/jumps endpoints.

Proof Point: You are testing the security and business logic using industry-standard tools in the same language as the application.

E2E UI Automation (Selenium Java):

Action: Create a separate repository named Skydiving-E2E-Test-Automation.

Implementation: Use Selenium WebDriver with Java bindings and implement the Page Object Model (POM) structure. Cover at least five critical business scenarios: User Registration → Login → Create Jump → Edit Jump → View Stats → Logout.

Proof Point: You can design maintainable, readable E2E tests, which is a core SDET responsibility.

Reporting Integration:

Action: Integrate the API and E2E test runs with Allure Report.

Proof Point: Professional reporting demonstrates an understanding of the outcome of testing, not just the code.

DevOps / SRE Path: Project Adaptation

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end responsibility: Code to Production (C2P).

Containerization (Docker):

Action: Add a multi-stage Dockerfile to your main repo.

Implementation: Stage 1 uses a JDK image to run Gradle and build the .jar. Stage 2 uses a minimal JRE image to run the .jar. This demonstrates optimization and security awareness.

Action: Add a docker-compose.yml to spin up the Spring Boot container and a dedicated MySQL container for local running.

CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions - PRIORITY):

Action: Create the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file.

Implementation: The workflow must sequence:

Checkout code.

Set up Java/Gradle.

Run Unit/Integration Tests (gradlew test).

Run a RestAssured smoke test (using the API Test Suite created in the QA section).

Build the Docker Image.

Push the image to the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

Proof Point: This is a live, automated pipeline that proves you understand the entire release process.

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/AWS):

Action: Create a small, separate repo: Skydiving-Infra-AWS.

Implementation: Use Terraform to define a basic AWS EC2 instance. Include a user data script (Bash) to install Docker and run the docker-compose.yml file, pulling the latest image from GHCR.

Proof Point: You can provision and deploy infrastructure reliably and programmatically.
