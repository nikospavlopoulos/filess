**\[USER\]**

**\[ASSISTANT\]**

Alright, let's cut through the noise and build you a real roadmap. You're 40, pivoting from sales into tech, and you want zero customer-facing BS. That's doable, but it requires surgical precision in positioning and rapid upskilling. Let's dissect this.

* * *

## **1\. PROFILE ANALYSIS & DIFFERENTIATORS**

You're not a typical bootcamp grad, and that's actually your edge—if you play it right.

### **Core Transferable Assets:**

- **Data-Driven Problem Solving:** Your Power BI/Excel automation work at CHEP wasn't just spreadsheet jockeying. You analyzed supply chain data, built dashboards, identified asset leakage patterns, and drove corrective actions. That's the exact workflow of a Data Analyst, BI Developer, or even a Junior Data Engineer. You understand the "why" behind data, not just the "how."
    
- **Process Optimization & Systems Thinking:** Managing asset flows, reducing losses, developing commercial agreements—you've operated in complex systems with multiple stakeholders. That maps directly to DevOps thinking, QA strategy, and technical project coordination.
    
- **Risk Management & Compliance:** Your IOSH certification and safety audit experience show you can work within regulated frameworks, document processes, and ensure compliance. Tech needs this in DevOps (infrastructure security), QA (test compliance), and Data Engineering (GDPR, data governance).
    
- **Stakeholder Communication (Non-Sales Context):** As a Skydiving Coach and Toastmasters President, you've trained, mentored, and led teams. That's valuable in Technical Writing, Developer Advocacy (internal), QA Leadership, or Technical Program Management—but only if framed as *enabling technical teams*, not selling to customers.
    
- **Self-Directed Learning & Execution:** You built two functioning Spring Boot projects, achieved 95% test coverage, self-hosted a WordPress blog that ranked on Google's first page, and completed Harvard's CS50x. You ship. That matters more than a degree when you're 40.
    

### **The Age Factor—Brutal Reality:**

- **Disadvantage:** Hiring managers will wonder why you're starting at 40. Younger devs are cheaper, more moldable, and perceived as "hungrier." You'll face unconscious bias in CV screening and interviews.
- **Advantage:** You've managed budgets, worked under pressure, navigated corporate politics, and delivered results in ambiguous situations. Junior devs straight out of school crumble when projects derail or requirements change. You won't. You also have a decade of B2B relationship management—useful in roles interfacing with internal stakeholders (not customers).

### **The Greek/European Market Reality:**

Greece's tech scene is growing but still lags Western Europe in salary and opportunity density. Remote work for EU companies is your best bet. You'll compete with:

- **Younger bootcamp grads** (25-30) with similar portfolios but less professional maturity.
- **CS grads** (22-26) with theory but often weak practical skills.
- **Eastern European devs** who'll undercut you on salary for remote roles.

Your edge: *You're not fighting on the same battlefield.* You're targeting roles that value operational maturity, not just coding speed.

* * *

## **2\. FEASIBLE CAREER PATHS ANALYSIS**

Here are **ten distinct, non-customer-facing technical roles** you can realistically target. I've ranked them by **feasibility in 1 month** and **fit with your background**.

* * *

### **PATH 1: QA Automation Engineer (Junior/Mid-Level)**

**Role Description & Fit:**  
You write automated tests to validate software functionality, often using Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, or RestAssured for API testing. Your Spring Boot projects already demonstrate solid JUnit/Mockito usage and 95% code coverage—that's the core skill. QA Automation sits between manual QA (too customer-facing) and pure development (too saturated for career changers). Your IOSH safety compliance background translates directly: testing is risk mitigation.

**Market Reality in Greece/Europe:**

- **Demand:** High. Every SaaS company needs QA automation. Greece has growing demand in fintech (e.g., Viva Wallet), logistics (e.g., Skroutz), and outsourcing firms (e.g., Kaizen Gaming).
- **Competition:** Moderate. Fewer candidates specialize in automation vs. manual QA. Java-based automation (Selenium + Spring Boot stack) is less crowded than JavaScript (Cypress/Playwright).
- **Entry Requirements:** Portfolio of test suites, understanding of CI/CD pipelines, familiarity with Git/Jenkins/GitLab CI.

**Competitive Analysis (40-Year-Old):**

- **Advantage:** QA teams value meticulousness, process adherence, and risk awareness—traits honed in compliance roles. Hiring managers will trust you won't cut corners.
- **Challenge:** Perceived as "less sexy" than dev roles, so some assume you're settling. Counter this by emphasizing your data analysis background and automation mindset.
- **Mitigation:** Frame your CHEP role as "ensuring operational integrity through data-driven monitoring and corrective action workflows"—literally what QA does.

**1-Month Upskilling Strategy:**

1.  **Week 1-2:** Build an **API Testing Framework** for your Skydiving REST API using RestAssured + JUnit 5. Add Cucumber for BDD-style tests (behavior-driven scenarios are huge in QA).
2.  **Week 3:** Add **Selenium WebDriver tests** for your Thymeleaf web app. Automate login, dashboard navigation, and form submissions. Use Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
3.  **Week 4:** Integrate tests into **GitHub Actions or GitLab CI** pipeline. Show automated test execution on every commit. Add a test report generator (Allure or ExtentReports).
4.  **Portfolio Project:** Create a separate GitHub repo: **"Comprehensive QA Automation Suite for REST API & Web App."** Document setup, test scenarios, and CI/CD integration in the README.
5.  **Learn:** Jenkins basics, Docker for test environment setup, SQL for database validation testing.

**Target Job Titles:** QA Automation Engineer, SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test), Test Automation Engineer, Automation Specialist.

* * *

### **PATH 2: Backend Developer (Java/Spring Boot) - Junior**

**Role Description & Fit:**  
You build server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions. Your two Spring Boot projects already prove you can do this. Backend dev is pure logic—no UI, no customer calls, just coding. Your REST API with JWT auth and 95% test coverage is already a strong portfolio piece.

**Market Reality in Greece/Europe:**

- **Demand:** Very high. Every company needs backend engineers. Spring Boot is especially in-demand in enterprise/fintech.
- **Competition:** Brutal. This is the most saturated junior dev role. You're competing with CS grads, bootcamp grads, and junior devs with 1-2 years of experience.
- **Entry Requirements:** Live projects, understanding of microservices, databases, and Docker. Many companies want some experience with cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).

**Competitive Analysis (40-Year-Old):**

- **Advantage:** You've shipped working code. Many juniors can't. Your 95% test coverage signals professionalism—most juniors skip tests.
- **Challenge:** Age bias is strongest here. Hiring managers often want "moldable" juniors who'll work long hours for low pay. At 40, they'll assume you're inflexible or won't take feedback.
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize learning velocity. Add timestamps to your GitHub commits showing you shipped both projects in under a year. Mention CS50x completion. Highlight your safety audit history—you're used to rigorous feedback loops.

**1-Month Upskilling Strategy:**

1.  **Week 1:** Add **PostgreSQL** support to your REST API (switch from MySQL). Deploy it to a free cloud host (Render, Railway, or Fly.io) with a live demo link.
2.  **Week 2:** Refactor your API into **microservices**. Split authentication logic into a separate Auth Service. Use Spring Cloud or just separate Spring Boot apps with RestTemplate for inter-service calls.
3.  **Week 3:** Add **Docker Compose** setup. Containerize your API, database, and (if applicable) a frontend. Document how to run the entire stack with one command.
4.  **Week 4:** Build a third project: **"Job Application Tracker API"** (meta, right?). Features: CRUD for job listings, application status tracking, notes, deadlines. Add search/filter functionality and pagination. This shows you can build real-world CRUD apps beyond passion projects.
5.  **Learn:** Spring Boot Actuator (monitoring), Redis (caching), Kafka (if you're ambitious—event-driven architecture is hot).

**Target Job Titles:** Junior Backend Developer, Java Developer, Spring Boot Developer, API Developer.

* * *

### **PATH 3: Data Engineer (Entry-Level / Junior)**

**Role Description & Fit:**  
You build and maintain data pipelines, ETL processes, and data warehouses. Your Power BI/Excel automation at CHEP and R statistical analysis project show you understand data workflows. Data Engineering is backend engineering for data—less about app logic, more about moving/transforming data at scale.

**Market Reality in Greece/Europe:**

- **Demand:** Extremely high and growing faster than supply. Every company needs data infrastructure. Greece's demand is moderate locally but very high for remote EU roles.
- **Competition:** Lower than backend dev. Data Engineering requires a broader skillset (SQL, Python, cloud, orchestration tools), which filters out many candidates.
- **Entry Requirements:** SQL mastery, Python (pandas, PySpark), familiarity with cloud data tools (AWS S3, Glue, Redshift or GCP BigQuery), and orchestration (Airflow, Prefect).

**Competitive Analysis (40-Year-Old):**

- **Advantage:** Your data analysis background at CHEP is gold here. You've already identified data quality issues (equipment flow accuracy), built dashboards, and automated workflows. Data Engineers need to understand business context, not just write pipelines—you have that.
- **Challenge:** Most Data Engineers come from analytics or backend dev backgrounds with strong Python skills. Your Java focus is less common in this field.
- **Mitigation:** Pivot to Python quickly. Emphasize your R project (shows statistical thinking) and Excel automation (shows you understand ETL concepts). Learn SQL deeply—it's the universal language in data.

**1-Month Upskilling Strategy:**

1.  **Week 1:** Learn **Python for Data Engineering**: pandas, requests (API data extraction), SQLAlchemy. Rebuild your airplane crash analysis in Python with pandas + matplotlib/seaborn.
2.  **Week 2:** Build a **data pipeline project**: Extract data from a public API (e.g., OpenWeather, CoinGecko), transform it (clean, aggregate), and load it into PostgreSQL. Use Python scripts with error handling and logging.
3.  **Week 3:** Add **Apache Airflow** to orchestrate your pipeline. Schedule daily runs, add monitoring, and handle failures. Deploy Airflow locally with Docker Compose.
4.  **Week 4:** Learn **AWS basics**: S3 (data storage), Lambda (serverless functions), RDS (managed DB). Migrate your pipeline to run on AWS (extract → S3 → Lambda transformation → RDS). Use free tier.
5.  **Portfolio Project:** **"Automated Weather Data Pipeline with Airflow & AWS."** Document architecture, DAG structure, and error handling in the README.

**Target Job Titles:** Junior Data Engineer, ETL Developer, Data Pipeline Engineer, Analytics Engineer.

* * *

### **PATH 4: DevOps Engineer (Junior / Entry-Level)**

**Role Description & Fit:**  
You manage infrastructure, automate deployments, and ensure systems run reliably. Your IOSH safety compliance background is surprisingly relevant—DevOps is about risk management, monitoring, and ensuring uptime. Your Spring Boot projects need deployment; DevOps is how you'd scale them.

**Market Reality in Greece/Europe:**

- **Demand:** Very high. Every company needs infrastructure automation. Greece's local demand is moderate but growing; remote EU roles are plentiful.

- **Entry Requirements:** Linux proficiency, Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions), cloud experience (AWS/GCP/Azure), scripting (Bash, Python).

**Competitive Analysis (40-Year-Old):**

- **Advantage:** DevOps values operational maturity and calm under pressure. Your decade in operations-adjacent roles (asset management, safety compliance) shows you can handle production incidents without panicking.
- **Challenge:** DevOps culture skews younger (lots of startups). Some teams may doubt your ability to learn fast or adapt to on-call rotations.
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize your self-hosting experience (WordPress blog), safety audit history (shows you follow procedures), and ability to automate workflows (Excel/Power BI tools). Learn Kubernetes fast—it's the industry standard.

**1-Month Upskilling Strategy:**

1.  **Week 1:** Master **Docker**. Containerize your Spring Boot apps, databases, and frontend. Write clean Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml files.
2.  **Week 2:** Learn **Kubernetes basics**. Deploy your Skydiving API to a local Minikube cluster. Create Deployments, Services, and Ingress configs.
3.  **Week 3:** Build a **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions. Automate: code checkout → build → test → Docker image build → push to Docker Hub → deploy to a cloud VM (e.g., AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean Droplet).
4.  **Week 4:** Learn **Terraform** (Infrastructure as Code). Define your AWS/GCP resources (VMs, databases, networking) in Terraform configs. Deploy infrastructure with one command.
5.  **Learn:** Ansible (configuration management), Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring), Nginx (reverse proxy/load balancing).

**Target Job Titles:** Junior DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), Infrastructure Engineer, Platform Engineer.

* * *

### **PATH 5: Business Intelligence (BI) Developer**

**Role Description & Fit:**  
You build dashboards, reports, and data visualizations for business decision-making. Your Power BI experience at CHEP is directly transferable. BI sits between data analysis and data engineering—you're not selling insights (like a BI Analyst might), just building the tools.

**Market Reality in Greece/Europe:**

- **Demand:** High, especially in mid-sized companies (50-500 employees) that need internal reporting tools. Greece has moderate demand; remote EU roles are common.
- **Competition:** Lower than pure dev roles. BI requires domain knowledge and data modeling skills that many devs lack.
- **Entry Requirements:** SQL mastery, Power BI/Tableau/Looker, understanding of data warehouses (star schema, fact/dimension tables), ETL basics.

**Competitive Analysis (40-Year-Old):**

- **Advantage:** You've already done this job at CHEP. Reframe your Excel automation and Power BI dashboards as "BI Development"—because that's what they were.
- **Challenge:** BI roles can sometimes bleed into customer-facing work (presenting to stakeholders). You need to target **internal BI Developer** roles, not BI Analyst/Consultant.
- **Mitigation:** Specify in applications that you're targeting *technical development* of BI tools, not analysis or stakeholder presentations. Emphasize SQL, data modeling, and automation.

**1-Month Upskilling Strategy:**

1.  **Week 1:** Rebuild your CHEP dashboards (without proprietary data) in Power BI with synthetic data. Show: KPIs, trends, drill-downs, and alerts.
2.  **Week 2:** Learn **SQL deeply**. Practice window functions, CTEs, query optimization on LeetCode SQL or HackerRank. Build a complex query portfolio.
3.  **Week 3:** Learn **dbt (data build tool)**—it's huge in modern BI. Use dbt to transform raw data into analytics-ready tables. Document your transformations.
4.  **Week 4:** Build a **BI project**: Create a dashboard for your airplane crash analysis data. Extract data from CSV → load into PostgreSQL → transform with dbt → visualize in Power BI or Metabase (open-source). Deploy Metabase with Docker.
5.  **Portfolio Project:** **"End-to-End BI Pipeline: Data Modeling, Transformation & Visualization."** Host on GitHub with SQL scripts, dbt models, and dashboard screenshots.

**Target Job Titles:** BI Developer, Data Visualization Developer, Reporting Developer, Analytics Engineer.

* * *

### **PATH 6: Technical Writer (Developer Documentation)**

**Role Description & Fit:**  
You write documentation for APIs, SDKs, and internal tools. Your ProudPro.gr blog (ranked #1 on Google for Greek sales terms) proves you can write clearly and optimize for SEO. Your Spring Boot projects need good READMEs—that's half the battle.

**Market Reality in Greece/Europe:**

- **Demand:** Moderate but steady. Every SaaS company needs docs. Greece's local demand is low; remote EU/US roles are plentiful.
- **Competition:** Lower. Few developers write well. Fewer writers code. You're in the Venn diagram overlap.
- **Entry Requirements:** Portfolio of technical writing samples, basic coding ability (to test docs), familiarity with Git, Markdown, and docs platforms (GitBook, ReadMe.io, Docusaurus).

**Competitive Analysis (40-Year-Old):**

- **Advantage:** Your blog success shows you understand audience needs and can produce consistent, high-quality content. Your training experience (AIESEC, Toastmasters) shows you can distill complex ideas into learnable chunks—exactly what docs require.
- **Challenge:** Technical writing is often freelance/contract-based. Stability may be lower than full-time dev roles.
- **Mitigation:** Target companies with large developer platforms (e.g., Stripe, Twilio, AWS) that need full-time technical writers. Emphasize your ability to *write code* and *test APIs*, not just describe them.

**1-Month Upskilling Strategy:**

1.  **Week 1:** Rewrite your Skydiving REST API documentation as **professional API docs**. Use Swagger/OpenAPI spec to generate interactive docs. Add code examples in multiple languages (Java, cURL, JavaScript).
2.  **Week 2:** Write a **tutorial series**: "Building a REST API with Spring Boot from Scratch." Include setup, authentication, testing, and deployment. Publish on Dev.to or Hashnode.
3.  **Week 3:** Learn **Docusaurus** (Facebook's docs framework). Build a documentation site for your projects with tutorials, API reference, and FAQs. Deploy on Netlify or Vercel.
4.  **Week 4:** Contribute to **open-source documentation**. Find a Java/Spring project on GitHub with poor docs. Submit PRs improving README, API docs, or setup guides. (Boosts your GitHub profile and shows collaboration skills.)

* * *

## **4\. IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN: 5-WEEK ROADMAP**

Here's your tactical, week-by-week plan to maximize your job-readiness in 5 weeks. Pick **one primary career path** (I recommend QA Automation or Backend Dev based on your current portfolio) and execute.

* * *

### **WEEK 1: Polish Foundations & Pick Your Path**

**Goal:** Finalize your primary career path, audit your current portfolio, and fix gaps.

**Daily Tasks:**

- **Day 1-2:** Review all 10 career paths above. Pick your top 2 (e.g., QA Automation + Backend Dev). Research 20 job postings for each on LinkedIn (Greece + remote EU) and document the most common required skills.
    
- **Day 3-4:** Audit your GitHub repos. Are READMEs professional? Do projects run without errors? Add setup instructions, architecture diagrams (use draw.io or Mermaid), and demo videos/GIFs (use Loom or OBS for screen recording). Fix any broken links.
    
- **Day 5-7:** Deep-dive into the skill gaps you identified from job postings. If targeting QA Automation and most jobs want Selenium + CI/CD, start tutorials. If targeting Backend Dev and jobs want Docker, prioritize that.
    

**Deliverables by End of Week 1:**

- ✅ Career path decision documented (primary + backup)
- ✅ GitHub profile cleaned up with professional READMEs
- ✅ List of 10 target companies (mix of Greek + remote EU)

* * *

## **BRUTAL TRUTHS & PSYCHOLOGICAL PREP**

Let's talk about what you'll face and how to handle it.

### **Rejection Rate Reality:**

- **Expect:** 10-20 applications per interview. As a 40-year-old career changer, it might be 30-40 applications per interview initially.
- **Why:** Age bias is real. Automated ATS systems may filter you out. Junior dev roles are saturated.
- **Response:** It's a numbers game. Every "no" brings you closer to a "yes." Track applications in a spreadsheet (company, date, role, status) to stay motivated and identify patterns.

### **Salary Expectations (Greece):**

- **Junior Backend Dev:** €18k-€28k/year (Athens-based, local companies)
- **Junior QA Automation:** €20k-€30k/year
- **Remote EU roles:** €30k-€50k/year (but more competitive)
- **Reality Check:** You'll likely take a 30-50% pay cut from sales roles initially. But tech has better long-term trajectory. After 2-3 years, you'll surpass your sales income.

### **The Age Question in Interviews:**

You **will** be asked some version of "Why are you changing careers at 40?" Here's how to handle it:

**❌ Weak Answer:**  
"I got tired of sales. I've always been interested in tech."

**✅ Strong Answer:**  
"I've been solving technical problems my whole career—automating Excel workflows, building Power BI dashboards, analyzing data to drive decisions. The only difference now is I'm using code instead of spreadsheets. I finally realized I could do this full-time, so I spent the last year formally reskilling. My operational background gives me an edge: I understand how to ship reliable solutions under pressure, which many junior devs haven't experienced yet."

### **Imposter Syndrome:**

You'll feel it. "Everyone else has a CS degree." "I'm too old." "I don't belong here."

**Reality:** Half of working developers are self-taught or bootcamp grads. Many 25-year-olds with CS degrees can't build what you've built. Your imposter syndrome is louder because you're hyperaware of what you don't know—that's actually a sign of competence.

**Counter-Strategy:** Keep a "wins document." Every time you solve a bug, ship a feature, or get positive feedback, write it down. Read it when doubt creeps in.

* * *

## **QUESTIONS TO DEEPEN YOUR STRATEGY**

Here are follow-up questions to help you refine your approach:

### **Career Path Selection:**

1.  Which of the 10 career paths resonates most with you emotionally? Where do you see yourself in 3 years—deep in code, coordinating teams, or building data infrastructure?
2.  Are you willing to do on-call rotations (nights/weekends) if it means getting into DevOps/SRE faster?
3.  How important is job stability vs. learning velocity? (Startups = fast learning but risky; corporates = stable but slower growth)

### **Portfolio & Technical Depth:**

4.  What was the hardest technical challenge you faced building your Spring Boot projects? How did you solve it? (This becomes your best interview story.)
5.  Are you comfortable reading and debugging other people's code? (Critical for open-source contributions and most jobs.)
6.  Which part of your stack do you enjoy most: backend logic, data manipulation, or infrastructure/deployment?

### **Market & Salary:**

7.  What's your minimum acceptable salary? How long can you sustain the job search financially?
8.  Are you open to contract/freelance work initially to get your foot in the door, or do you need full-time employment immediately?
9.  Would you relocate within Greece (e.g., Athens to Thessaloniki) or within the EU for the right opportunity?

### **Networking & Visibility:**

10. Do you have any existing connections in tech (former colleagues, Toastmasters members, AIESEC alumni who transitioned)? Can you leverage them for referrals?
11. Are you comfortable with video content, or would you prefer to build your brand through writing/blogging?
12. What's your elevator pitch right now? Can you explain what you do in 30 seconds to a non-technical person?

### **Long-Term Vision:**

13. In 5 years, do you want to stay hands-on (coding daily) or move into leadership (managing teams/projects)?
14. Are there specific industries you're drawn to (fintech, logistics, healthcare, gaming)?
15. What does success look like for you beyond just "getting a tech job"? What kind of work would make you excited to wake up?

* * *

**You've got a legitimate shot at this.** Your background isn't a liability—it's differentiation. Most junior devs can't analyze data, manage stakeholders, or ship under pressure. You can. The key is positioning yourself in roles where that matters and executing the upskilling plan with intensity.

You're not starting from zero. You're pivoting from a position of strength. Now go build, apply, and network like your career depends on it—because it does.

What's your biggest concern right now? And which of the 10 paths are you leaning toward?

# Your Hyper-Focused QA/SDET & DevOps/SRE Career Sprint Plan

Alright, let's build your battle plan. You've got solid Java/Spring Boot fundamentals, a killer project that's 95% there, and exactly one month to turn it into an irresistible portfolio for those November career fairs. No fluff—just surgical precision on what matters.

* * *

## **1\. TECHNOLOGY & TOOLING BLUEPRINT**

Here's your learning stack, prioritized ruthlessly by ROI and integration with your existing Java/Spring Boot foundation.

### **PATH A: QA/Test Automation Engineer (SDET)**

| **Category** | **Technology/Tool** | **Integration with Your Stack** | **Priority** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CORE & IMMEDIATE** |     |     |     |
| **Selenium WebDriver (Java)** | Test your Skydiving Thymeleaf UI. Uses Java bindings—you already know Java, so the learning curve is just the WebDriver API. Create Page Object Model (POM) classes that mirror your Spring controllers. | Write UI tests for login, registration, dashboard navigation, jump creation flows. | **CRITICAL** |
| **RestAssured (Java)** | API testing library specifically for REST APIs. Since your Skydiving API is REST-based, RestAssured lets you write readable, fluent tests like `given().auth().oauth2(token).when().get("/api/jumps/all").then().statusCode(200)`. | Build comprehensive API test suite for all your endpoints. Test auth flows, CRUD operations, search filters, pagination. | **CRITICAL** |
| **Postman/Newman** | Postman for manual API exploration; Newman for automated Postman collection execution in CI/CD. Export your Postman collections to JSON and run them in pipelines. | Document and test all 15+ API endpoints. Create collections for happy paths, edge cases, auth failures. | **CRITICAL** |
| **TestNG or JUnit 5** | You already use JUnit for unit tests. Extend it for integration/E2E tests or switch to TestNG (better for data-driven testing and parallel execution). | Organize your Selenium and RestAssured tests with TestNG annotations like `@Test`, `@BeforeClass`, `@DataProvider` for parameterized tests. | **CRITICAL** |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub. Runs tests on every commit/PR. You're already on GitHub—this is the easiest CI/CD to start with. | Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` that runs your JUnit, RestAssured, and Selenium tests automatically. Fail builds if coverage drops. | **CRITICAL** |
| **Bash Scripting** | Automate test setup: spin up test databases, seed data, tear down environments. Essential for QA infrastructure. | Write `setup-test-db.sh` that initializes H2/MySQL with test data before running tests. Write `run-tests.sh` that orchestrates test execution with proper error handling. | **HIGH** |
| **SQL (Advanced)** | You know basic SQL. QA needs advanced: complex joins, window functions, data validation queries. | Write SQL queries to validate data integrity after CRUD operations. Test that `jump_number` increments correctly, foreign keys are valid, orphaned records don't exist. | **HIGH** |
|     |     |     |     |
| **INTERMEDIATE & EXPANDING** |     |     |     |
| **Cucumber (BDD)** | Behavior-Driven Development. Write tests in plain English (Gherkin syntax). Great for collaboration with non-technical stakeholders—but you don't have those. | Convert some Selenium tests to Cucumber format: `Feature: User Login`, `Scenario: Valid credentials`. Shows you know BDD, but don't overdo it. | **MEDIUM** |
| **Allure/ExtentReports** | Test reporting frameworks. Generate beautiful HTML reports with charts, screenshots, logs. | Integrate with TestNG/JUnit to produce reports showing test pass/fail rates, execution time, flaky tests. Add to CI/CD pipeline. | **MEDIUM** |
| **Docker (for test environments)** | Containerize test environments for consistency. Run tests in isolated containers. | Create `docker-compose-test.yml` that spins up MySQL + your API in containers, runs tests, tears down. Ensures tests are reproducible. | **MEDIUM** |
| **Python (basic)** | Python is huge in QA automation (Pytest, Robot Framework). You don't need deep expertise, but basic Python scripts for utilities help. | Write Python scripts to: generate test data CSVs, parse test logs, send Slack notifications on test failures, analyze JaCoCo reports. | **MEDIUM** |
| **Jenkins** | Traditional CI/CD tool. More complex than GitHub Actions but common in enterprises. | Set up a Jenkins pipeline that pulls your repo, builds with Gradle, runs tests, publishes reports. Document setup in README. | **LOW (offer to learn)** |
|     |     |     |     |
| **NICE-TO-HAVE & FUTURE** |     |     |     |
| **K6 or JMeter** | Performance/load testing tools. Test API throughput, response times under load. | Run load tests on `/api/jumps/all` with 100 concurrent users. Document performance bottlenecks. | **LOW** |
| **Cypress/Playwright** | Modern UI testing frameworks (JavaScript). Faster than Selenium but require JS knowledge. | Learn basics, mention in resume as "familiar with." Don't build projects—your time is limited. | **VERY LOW** |
| **Appium** | Mobile testing framework. For Android/iOS apps. | Only relevant if you build the Android app (Phase 2). Skip for now. | **SKIP** |

* * *

### **PATH B: DevOps/Build & Release/CI-CD/SRE**

| **Category** | **Technology/Tool** | **Integration with Your Stack** | **Priority** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CORE & IMMEDIATE** |     |     |     |
| **Docker** | Containerization. Package your Spring Boot app + MySQL into portable containers. | Create `Dockerfile` for your API (multi-stage build: Gradle build → slim runtime image). Create `docker-compose.yml` with API + MySQL services. | **CRITICAL** |
| **GitHub Actions** | Same as QA path—CI/CD is DevOps bread and butter. | Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: build Docker image → push to Docker Hub → deploy to AWS EC2 (or just build for now). | **CRITICAL** |
| **Bash Scripting** | DevOps is 50% Bash. Automate deployments, health checks, log parsing, backups. | Write `deploy.sh` that pulls latest code, rebuilds Docker image, restarts containers with zero downtime. Write `healthcheck.sh` that pings `/actuator/health` and sends alerts. | **CRITICAL** |
| **AWS (EC2, RDS, S3)** | Cloud infrastructure. EC2 for VMs, RDS for managed MySQL, S3 for static files/backups. | Deploy your Dockerized API to an EC2 instance. Use RDS instead of self-hosted MySQL. Store database backups in S3. Use free tier. | **CRITICAL** |
| **Git (Advanced)** | You use Git basics. DevOps needs: branching strategies, merge conflict resolution, Git hooks for automation. | Implement Gitflow: `main` (production), `develop` (staging), feature branches. Add pre-commit hook that runs linters. | **HIGH** |
| **Nginx** | Reverse proxy and load balancer. Sits in front of your Spring Boot app to handle SSL, rate limiting, caching. | Deploy Nginx in Docker, proxy requests to your API container. Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse. | **HIGH** |
| **Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana** | Metrics collection and visualization. Prometheus scrapes metrics; Grafana displays dashboards. | Add Spring Boot Actuator with Prometheus endpoint. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics. Build Grafana dashboard showing request rate, error rate, response time, JVM memory. | **HIGH** |
| **Linux (Advanced)** | You're familiar with Ubuntu. Deepen: systemd, cron jobs, log management, process monitoring, security hardening. | SSH into your EC2 instance, set up systemd service for your app, configure log rotation with `logrotate`, secure with `ufw` firewall. | **HIGH** |
|     |     |     |     |
| **INTERMEDIATE & EXPANDING** |     |     |     |
| **Jenkins** | CI/CD workhorse in enterprises. More complex than GitHub Actions but expected knowledge. | Set up Jenkins on EC2 or locally. Create pipeline that: pulls code → runs tests → builds Docker → deploys. Use Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code). | **MEDIUM** |
| **Terraform** | Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Define AWS resources (EC2, RDS, VPC) in code. | Write `main.tf` that provisions your entire AWS infrastructure. Run `terraform apply` to deploy. Destroy with `terraform destroy`. Version-control your infrastructure. | **MEDIUM** |
| **Kubernetes (basics)** | Container orchestration. Industry standard for managing containerized apps at scale. | Deploy your API to Minikube (local K8s cluster). Create Deployment, Service, Ingress YAML files. Document setup—don't need to be an expert yet. | **MEDIUM** |
| **Ansible** | Configuration management. Automate server setup, package installation, app deployment. | Write Ansible playbook that: installs Docker, pulls your image, starts containers, configures firewall. Run against EC2 instance. | **MEDIUM** |
| **Python (for automation)** | Python is huge in DevOps for scripting complex automation tasks. | Write Python scripts to: parse CloudWatch logs, automate AWS resource cleanup, generate deployment reports, integrate with Slack for alerts. | **MEDIUM** |
| **Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** | Centralized logging. Collect logs from all services, search/analyze them, visualize in Kibana. | Configure your Spring Boot app to ship logs to Logstash. Set up Kibana dashboard showing error rates, slow queries. | **LOW** |
|     |     |     |     |
| **NICE-TO-HAVE & FUTURE** |     |     |     |
| **Kubernetes (advanced)** | StatefulSets, Helm charts, service mesh (Istio). | Only if you master basics first. Mention "learning K8s" in resume. | **VERY LOW** |
| **ArgoCD/Flux** | GitOps tools for K8s. Deployments triggered by Git commits. | Cool but overkill for your timeline. Skip. | **SKIP** |
| **Cloud Certifications** | AWS Certified Solutions Architect, etc. | Nice to have but takes weeks. Focus on hands-on projects. Mention "studying for AWS cert" if asked. | **SKIP (for now)** |

* * *

### **Cross-Functional Skills (Both Paths)**

| **Skill** | **Why It Matters** | **How to Apply** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bash Scripting** | QA: automate test setup. DevOps: automate everything. | Write at least 5 reusable scripts: test setup, deployment, health check, log analysis, backup. Document usage in README. |
| **Python** | QA: test utilities, data generation. DevOps: complex automation, AWS SDK. | Build 2-3 Python utilities: test data generator, log parser, AWS cost analyzer. Add to GitHub in separate repo. |
| **SQL (Advanced)** | QA: data validation. DevOps: database migrations, performance tuning. | Write complex queries: validate referential integrity, check for data anomalies, analyze slow query logs. |
| **Linux** | Both paths live in Linux environments. | Use Ubuntu daily. Learn: systemd, cron, ssh, vim, grep/awk/sed, process management, networking basics. |

* * *

## **2\. PORTFOLIO PROJECT STRATEGY**

Your Skydiving API is 80% of the way to being a showcase piece. Let's turn it into a dual-purpose portfolio that screams "hire me" for both QA and DevOps roles.

* * *

### **PROJECT A: QA/SDET Portfolio - "Comprehensive Testing Suite for Skydiving Logbook API"**

**Goal:** Transform your existing 95% unit test coverage into a multi-layered testing strategy that demonstrates end-to-end QA expertise.

#### **Phase 1: API Test Automation with RestAssured (Week 1)**

**What to Build:**

1.  **Create a new testing module** in your repo: `src/test/java/com/nikospavlopoulos/skydivingrest/apitests/`
    
2.  **Build RestAssured test suites** for all major API flows:
    
    - **Authentication Tests:**
        
        ```java
        @Test
        public void testLoginWithValidCredentials() {
            given()
                .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .body(new AuthenticationRequestDTO("testuser", "password"))
            .when()
                .post("/api/auth/login")
            .then()
                .statusCode(200)
                .body("token", notNullValue())
                .body("expiresIn", greaterThan(0));
        }
        
        @Test
        public void testLoginWithInvalidCredentials() {
            given()
                .contentType(ContentType.JSON)
                .body(new AuthenticationRequestDTO("testuser", "wrongpassword"))
            .when()
                .post("/api/auth/login")
            .then()
                .statusCode(401)
                .body("message", containsString("Invalid credentials"));
        }
        ```
        
    - **CRUD Tests for Jumps:**
        
        - Create jump (POST `/api/jumps`) with valid data → verify 201, check response body
        - Create jump with missing required fields → verify 400, check error messages
        - Get jump (GET `/api/jumps/{id}`) → verify 200, validate all fields
        - Update jump (PUT `/api/jumps/{id}`) → verify 200, confirm changes in DB
        - Delete jump (DELETE `/api/jumps/{id}`) → verify 204, confirm deletion
        - Try to delete another user's jump → verify 403
    - **Search & Pagination Tests:**
        
        - Test `/api/jumps/search` with various filters (date range, jump type)
        - Test pagination params (page, size, sort)
        - Test edge cases: page beyond available data, invalid sort field
    - **Aggregate Stats Tests:**
        
        - Create 5 jumps with known freefall times → verify `/api/jumps/totalfreefall` returns correct sum
        - Delete a jump → verify totals update correctly
3.  **Data-Driven Testing:**
    
    ```java
    @DataProvider(name = "invalidJumpData")
    public Object[][] invalidJumpData() {
        return new Object[][] {
            {null, 10000, "2024-01-01", "Missing aircraft"},
            {1L, -500, "2024-01-01", "Negative altitude"},
            {1L, 10000, "2025-12-31", "Future date"}
        };
    }
    
    @Test(dataProvider = "invalidJumpData")
    public void testCreateJumpWithInvalidData(Long aircraftId, Integer altitude, String date, String scenario) {
        // Test each invalid scenario
    }
    ```
    
4.  **Response Schema Validation:**
    
    ```java
    @Test
    public void testJumpResponseSchema() {
        given()
            .auth().oauth2(getValidToken())
        .when()
            .get("/api/jumps/1")
        .then()
            .statusCode(200)
            .body("id", isA(Integer.class))
            .body("jumpNumber", isA(Integer.class))
            .body("altitude", isA(Integer.class))
            .body("date", matchesPattern("\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}"))
            .body("aircraft.name", isA(String.class));
    }
    ```
    

**Deliverable:**

- 50+ RestAssured tests covering happy paths, error cases, edge cases, security (auth failures, unauthorized access)
- Organized in test classes: `AuthenticationApiTest`, `JumpCrudApiTest`, `SearchApiTest`, `LookupApiTest`
- README section: "API Test Suite" with coverage breakdown

#### **Phase 2: UI Test Automation with Selenium (Week 2)**

**What to Build:**

1.  **Set up Selenium WebDriver** in your project:
    
    ```gradle
    testImplementation 'org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-java:4.15.0'
    testImplementation 'io.github.bonigarcia:webdrivermanager:5.6.2'
    ```
    
2.  **Implement Page Object Model (POM):**
    
    ```java
    public class LoginPage {
        private WebDriver driver;
        
        @FindBy(id = "username")
        private WebElement usernameField;
        
        @FindBy(id = "password")
        private WebElement passwordField;
        
        @FindBy(id = "login-btn")
        private WebElement loginButton;
        
        public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
            this.driver = driver;
            PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
        }
        
        public DashboardPage login(String username, String password) {
            usernameField.sendKeys(username);
            passwordField.sendKeys(password);
            loginButton.click();
            return new DashboardPage(driver);
        }
        
        public boolean isErrorDisplayed() {
            return driver.findElement(By.className("error-message")).isDisplayed();
        }
    }
    ```
    
3.  **Build UI test flows:**
    
    - **Happy Path E2E:**
        
        - Navigate to login → enter valid credentials → verify redirect to dashboard
        - Dashboard displays correct username → click "Create Jump" → fill form → submit → verify jump appears in table
        - Click edit on jump → modify altitude → save → verify change reflected
        - Click delete → confirm → verify jump removed from table
    - **Error Handling:**
        
        - Submit login with empty fields → verify error messages
        - Submit jump form with invalid data → verify validation errors
        - Try to access dashboard without login → verify redirect to login
4.  **Cross-Browser Testing (if time permits):**
    
    ```java
    @Parameters("browser")
    @Test
    public void testLoginOnDifferentBrowsers(@Optional("chrome") String browser) {
        WebDriver driver = DriverFactory.createDriver(browser); // chrome, firefox, edge
        // Run tests
    }
    ```
    

**Deliverable:**

- 15+ Selenium tests organized in `src/test/java/com/nikospavlopoulos/skydivingrest/uitests/`
- Page Object classes for Login, Registration, Dashboard, Jump Form
- README section: "UI Test Suite" with instructions to run tests

    - Create folders for each endpoint category (Auth, Users, Jumps, Lookups)
        
    - Add pre-request scripts to auto-generate tokens
        
    - Add test assertions in Postman's "Tests" tab:
        
        ```javascript
        pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
            pm.response.to.have.status(200);
        });
        
        pm.test("Response has token", function () {
            pm.expect(pm.response.json()).to.have.property("token");
        });
        ```

### **PROJECT B: DevOps/SRE Portfolio - "Production-Ready Deployment Pipeline"**

**Goal:** Transform your local Spring Boot app into a fully containerized, cloud-deployed, monitored application with automated CI/CD.

* * *

#### **Phase 1: Dockerization (Week 1)**

**What to Build:**

1.  **Multi-Stage Dockerfile** (optimized for size and security):
    
    ```dockerfile
    # Build stage
    FROM gradle:8.5-jdk21-alpine AS build
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY build.gradle settings.gradle ./
    COPY src ./src
    RUN gradle build -x test --no-daemon
    
    # Runtime stage
    FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine
    WORKDIR /app
    
    # Create non-root user
    RUN addgroup -S spring && adduser -S spring -G spring
    USER spring:spring
    
    # Copy JAR from build stage
    COPY --from=build /app/build/libs/*.jar app.jar
    
    # Expose port
    EXPOSE 8080
    
    # Health check
    HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=40s \
      CMD wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/actuator/health || exit 1
    
    # Run application
    ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
    ```
    
2.  **Docker Compose for Local Development:**
    
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'
    
    services:
      mysql:
        image: mysql:8.0
        container_name: skydive-mysql
        environment:

            condition: service_healthy
        environment:
          SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/skydivingdb
          SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: skydiveuser
          SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: skydivepass
          SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: dev
        ports:
          - "8080:8080"
        networks:
          - skydive-network
        restart: unless-stopped
      
      nginx:
        image: nginx:alpine
        container_name: skydive-nginx
        depends_on:
          - api
        ports:
          - "80:80"
          - "443:443"
        volumes:

    networks:
      skydive-network:
        driver: bridge
    
    volumes:
      mysql-data:
    ```
    
3.  **Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration:**
    
    ```nginx
    upstream api_backend {
        server api:8080;
    }
    
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name localhost;
        
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://api_backend;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            
            # Rate limiting
            limit_req zone=api_limit burst=20 nodelay;
        }
        
        # Health check endpoint (bypass auth)
        location /actuator/health {
            proxy_pass http://api_backend;
            access_log off;
        }
    }
    
    # Rate limit zone definition
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=api_limit:10m rate=10r/s;
    ```
    
4.  **Bash Scripts for Container Management:**
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # deploy.sh - Zero-downtime deployment script
    
    set -e  # Exit on error
    
    echo "🚀 Starting deployment..."
    
    # Pull latest code
    git pull origin main
    
    # Build new image with timestamp tag
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
    docker build -t skydive-api:$TIMESTAMP -t skydive-api:latest .
    
    # Run tests in container
    echo "🧪 Running tests..."
    docker run --rm skydive-api:$TIMESTAMP ./gradlew test
    
    # Backup database
    echo "💾 Backing up database..."
    docker exec skydive-mysql mysqldump -u root -prootpassword skydivingdb > backup_$TIMESTAMP.sql
    
    # Rolling update
    echo "🔄 Performing rolling update..."
    docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build api
    
    # Health check
    echo "❤️ Waiting for health check..."
    for i in {1..30}; do
        if curl -f http://localhost:8080/actuator/health > /dev/null 2>&1; then
            echo "✅ Deployment successful!"
            exit 0
        fi
        echo "Waiting... ($i/30)"
        sleep 2
    done
    
    echo "❌ Deployment failed - health check timeout"
    docker-compose logs api
    exit 1
    ```
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # healthcheck.sh - Continuous health monitoring
    
    API_URL="http://localhost:8080/actuator/health"
    SLACK_WEBHOOK="your-webhook-url"  # Optional
    
    while true; do
        if ! curl -f $API_URL > /dev/null 2>&1; then
            echo "⚠️ API is DOWN at $(date)"
            # Optional: Send alert
            # curl -X POST $SLACK_WEBHOOK -d '{"text":"API is down!"}'
        fi
        sleep 60
    done
    ```
    

**Deliverable:**

#### **LinkedIn Summary Rewrite:**

**BEFORE:**

> Entry level Software Developer, with a background of 10+ years in Customer Service, Sales and Data Analysis in multinational professional environments...

**AFTER (Hybrid QA/DevOps Focus):**

```
Software Engineer specializing in Test Automation, DevOps, and Reliable System Design

I build tested, automated, production-ready applications. My flagship project—a REST API for skydiving jump management—demonstrates end-to-end technical capabilities: Spring Boot backend with JWT security, 95% test coverage (JUnit/Mockito), comprehensive API automation (RestAssured), UI testing (Selenium), containerized deployment (Docker), and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions).

TECHNICAL FOUNDATION:
• Backend: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, MySQL/PostgreSQL, JPA/Hibernate
• Testing: JUnit, Mockito, Selenium WebDriver, RestAssured, TestNG, API testing
• DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Bash scripting, Linux (Ubuntu)
• Cloud: AWS (EC2, RDS), Nginx, Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
• Tools: Git, Gradle, Postman, JIRA, JaCoCo, Terraform (learning)

WHAT I BRING FROM 10+ YEARS IN OPERATIONS:
My background in asset management and compliance isn't a detour—it's my competitive advantage. I've automated complex data workflows (Power BI/Excel), identified and resolved critical system issues preventing costly failures, and managed high-stakes operations requiring zero tolerance for error. I understand what production reliability means because I've lived it in non-technical contexts.

At CHEP (Brambles), I:
• Engineered automated monitoring dashboards processing 10k+ records monthly
• Identified data integrity issues through systematic validation, preventing €50k+ losses
• Achieved top compliance ratings (IOSH certified) through rigorous quality protocols
• Designed corrective action workflows—essentially debugging business processes

This operational maturity translates directly to QA and DevOps: I don't just write tests or deploy containers—I think systematically about failure modes, edge cases, monitoring strategies, and incident prevention.

CURRENT FOCUS:
Seeking QA Automation Engineer or DevOps/Build & Release Engineer roles (Athens or Remote EU) where I can apply technical skills and operational rigor to ensure software quality and system reliability.

Portfolio: github.nikospavlopoulos.com
Projects include: REST API with authentication, comprehensive test suites, Docker deployment, CI/CD automation, and monitoring dashboards.

Let's connect if you're building reliable systems and value engineers who think beyond code.

* * *

### **NOVEMBER 6 & 8: CAREER FAIRS - EXECUTION MODE**

#### **Your Approach Strategy:**

**1\. Target Companies (Priority Order):**  
**High Priority (QA/DevOps hiring):**

- Viva Wallet (fintech - needs QA/DevOps)
- Kaizen Gaming (gaming - heavy testing needs)
- Workable (SaaS - DevOps-heavy)
- Skroutz (e-commerce - large QA team)
- Beat (mobile app - testing critical)

**Medium Priority:**

- Plum, Ferrum, Epignosis (Athens startups)
- International companies (Canonical, GitLab if present)
- Tech consultancies (Accenture, Cognizant, Capgemini)

**2\. Opening Line (30-Second Pitch):**

**QA Version:**

> "Hi, I'm Nikos. I'm a Software Engineer specializing in test automation. I've built a production REST API with 95% test coverage using JUnit, comprehensive API automation with RestAssured, UI tests with Selenium, and full CI/CD with GitHub Actions. I'm bringing 10 years of operations experience where I automated data workflows and compliance testing. I'm looking for QA Automation or SDET roles where quality and reliability are non-negotiable. Here's my GitHub—everything's live and deployed."

**DevOps Version:**

> "Hi, I'm Nikos. I'm a Software Engineer focused on DevOps and reliable deployments. I've built and deployed a REST API on AWS with Docker containers, CI/CD pipelines, Nginx reverse proxy, and Prometheus monitoring. I'm bringing a decade of operations experience managing high-stakes systems. I'm targeting DevOps or Build & Release Engineer roles. Here's my portfolio—the app is live with full automation."

**3\. Conversation Flow:**

1.  **Open with pitch** (30 sec)
2.  **Show GitHub on phone/tablet** (have it ready)
3.  **Ask about their tech stack** ("What does your QA/DevOps infrastructure look like?")
4.  **Find connection points** ("We use Spring Boot too—here's how I handled JWT auth")
5.  **Ask about hiring process** ("What does your interview process look like for this role?")
6.  **Close strong** ("I'd love to continue this conversation. Can I send you my resume and GitHub link? What's the best next step?")

**4\. Red Flags to Address Proactively:**

- **Age:** "I'm not a typical junior—I bring operational maturity and a proven track record of shipping under pressure."
- **No CS Degree:** "I've completed Harvard's CS50x and built production systems. I ship code, not just study it."
- **Career Change:** "I've been solving technical problems my whole career—just with different tools. Now I'm using code."

**5\. What to Avoid:**

- ❌ Don't apologize for career change
- ❌ Don't mention "customer service" unless specifically asked about soft skills
- ❌ Don't oversell—let your portfolio speak
- ❌ Don't talk about salary at first conversation
- ❌ Don't badmouth previous roles
- ❌ Don't monopolize their time (5-7 minutes max per company)

**6\. Follow-Up Strategy:**

- [ ] Collect business cards
- [ ] Note specific conversation points immediately after each talk
- [ ] Send personalized LinkedIn connection requests that evening
- [ ] Follow up with email within 48 hours referencing specific conversation
- [ ] Apply to roles on their website (mention you met at career fair)

* * *

## **DEEPENING QUESTIONS FOR YOUR STRATEGIC REFINEMENT**

### **Technical Depth:**

1.  **What excites you more:** debugging a flaky test and making it rock-solid, or optimizing a deployment pipeline to reduce downtime? (This reveals whether you're truly QA-natured or DevOps-natured.)
    
2.  **Your Skydiving API has 95% coverage—what's NOT covered and why?** Understanding your blind spots will help you explain trade-offs in interviews.
    
3.  **If a recruiter asks "Can you debug production incidents at 2 AM?"** how do you feel about that? (SRE/DevOps often requires on-call. Are you genuinely okay with this?)
    

### **Portfolio Strategy:**

4.  **Which feels more natural to showcase:** a test automation framework with 100 tests and beautiful Allure reports, or a Kubernetes deployment with monitoring dashboards? (Focus 70% on what feels natural, 30% on the other.)
    
5.  **Your REST API is your flagship—but is it production-grade in YOUR mind?** What would you still add if given unlimited time? (This becomes your "future improvements" talking point.)
    

### **Market Positioning:**

6.  **In the Greek market, are you willing to start at junior salaries (€20-25k) if it gets you in the door faster?** Or do you need minimum €30k+ to sustain yourself? (This determines whether you target startups vs. established companies.)
    
7.  **Remote EU vs. Athens local—what's your priority?** Remote EU pays better but is more competitive. Athens local is easier to network into but pays less.
    
8.  **Would you take a contract role (3-6 months) to build experience, or only full-time permanent?** Contractors sometimes transition to permanent after proving value.
    

### **Career Fair Tactics:**

9.  **Are you more comfortable leading with "I'm a QA Engineer" or "I'm a Software Engineer who specializes in quality and automation"?** The framing matters—test which gets better reactions.
    
10. **If a company says "We're looking for 2+ years of experience"—do you walk away or pitch anyway?** (Hint: Always pitch. Requirements are wishlists, not laws.)
    

### **Psychological Readiness:**

11. **How do you handle rejection?** You'll face 10-20+ rejections before an offer. Do you have support systems (friends, mentors, communities) to maintain momentum?
    
12. **What's your "I can't give up because..." anchor?** What's the non-negotiable reason you MUST succeed in this transition? (Keep this visible on tough days.)
    

### **Long-Term Vision:**

13. **In 3 years, where do you want to be:** a Senior QA Engineer leading automation strategy, or a Senior DevOps Engineer managing cloud infrastructure? (Helps prioritize learning now.)
    
14. **Would you consider freelancing/consulting if employment takes longer than 3 months?** Building automation frameworks for small companies could generate income while job hunting.
    
15. **What's your "dream company" in Greece?** If you could work anywhere, who would it be? (Helps focus networking efforts.)
    

* * *

## **FINAL ENCOURAGEMENT & REALITY CHECK**

You have **one month**. That's not much time, but it's enough if you execute with surgical precision.

### **What You Have Going For You:**

1.  **Solid technical foundation** - Your Spring Boot projects are real, not toy apps
2.  **95% test coverage** - Most juniors don't test at all
3.  **Operational maturity** - You've managed complex systems under pressure
4.  **Self-direction** - You taught yourself to code and shipped projects
5.  **Communication skills** - Toastmasters gives you an edge in interviews
6.  **Work ethic** - Your career history shows consistent performance

### **What You're Up Against:**

1.  **Age bias** - Some companies will filter you out sight unseen
2.  **Saturated junior market** - Tons of bootcamp grads and CS students competing
3.  **Experience gap** - You don't have "2 years professional experience"
4.  **Imposter syndrome** - You'll doubt yourself constantly
5.  **Timeline pressure** - 1 month is tight, 3 months is your real deadline

### **Your Differentiators (What Makes You Hire-able):**

1.  **You ship complete projects** - Not just code snippets
2.  **You understand production concerns** - Testing, monitoring, deployment
3.  **You have business context** - You've worked in real companies with stakeholders
4.  **You automate by instinct** - Power BI/Excel work proves this
5.  **You don't need hand-holding** - Self-taught professionals figure shit out

### **The Brutal Truth:**

- You'll probably need **30-50 applications** to get 5-10 interviews
- You'll probably need **5-10 interviews** to get 1-2 offers
- You'll probably face rejection 10-20 times before success
- You'll probably start at a lower salary than you'd like
- You'll probably work harder in your first tech job than your previous roles

### **But Here's the Counterpoint:**

- Every rejection is practice for the next interview
- Your first tech job is a **stepping stone**, not a destination
- In 2-3 years, you'll surpass your old salary trajectory
- The technical skills you're building are **permanent assets**
- Once you're "in," the age bias disappears (proven tech professional)

* * *

## **YOUR COMMITMENT (Sign Mentally)**

For the next 30 days, I commit to:

- [ ] Code/learn for 4-6 hours daily (minimum 3 hours on weekdays, 6+ on weekends)
    
- [ ] Make at least 3 commits per day showing progress
    
- [ ] Apply to 5-7 jobs per week starting Week 4
    
- [ ] Network with 5 new people per week (LinkedIn/meetups)
    
- [ ] Update my portfolio weekly with tangible improvements
    
- [ ] Practice my elevator pitch daily until it's muscle memory
    
- [ ] Not let rejection derail my momentum
    
- [ ] Ask for help when stuck (communities, mentors, forums)
    
- [ ] Document my learning journey (blog posts, README updates)
    
- [ ] Show up to those career fairs prepared and confident
    

**The Prize:** A career where you solve problems with code, not sales pitches. Where your work compounds over time. Where your skills make you increasingly valuable, not replaceable.

**The Cost:** 30 days of intensity, 3 months of uncertainty, and permanent discomfort with your old career.

**The Question:** Are you willing to pay it?

* * *

## **EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

Things will go wrong. Here's how to handle common issues:

### **Technical Roadblocks:**

**"My tests are failing in CI/CD but pass locally"**

- Check environment differences (Java version, timezone, file paths)
- Use Docker to reproduce CI environment locally
- Add debug logging to CI workflow
- Check for test interdependencies (one test affecting another)
- Ask on Stack Overflow with minimal reproducible example

**"AWS deployment failed / app won't start on EC2"**

- SSH into instance: `ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@public-ip`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check security group rules (ports open?)
- Test locally with same environment variables
- Stack Overflow + AWS forums are your friends

**"Docker build fails / container crashes immediately"**

- Build image locally first: `docker build -t test .`
- Run interactively: `docker run -it test /bin/sh` (debug inside container)
- Check Dockerfile syntax (multi-stage COPY paths)
- Verify JAR file location in build output
- Test with simpler Dockerfile first, then add complexity

**"Selenium tests are flaky / timing out"**

- Add explicit waits: `WebDriverWait` instead of `Thread.sleep()`
- Increase timeout values for slow networks
- Run headless for CI: `ChromeOptions.addArguments("--headless")`
- Check for element state before interaction (clickable, visible)
- Use Page Object Model to encapsulate wait logic

### **Time Management Issues:**

**"I'm falling behind the schedule"**

- **Priority triage:** Focus on Week 1-2 deliverables (QA basics + deployment)
- Skip "nice-to-haves": Terraform, ELK stack, portfolio website
- Merge Week 3-4: Do bare minimum on DevOps portfolio
- **Must-haves by Nov 6:** Live deployed API, RestAssured tests, Docker, CI/CD, polished resume
- Cut sleep if needed for 48 hours before career fair (not sustainable long-term)

**"I have a full-time job/commitments"**

- Wake up 2 hours earlier (code before work)
- Use lunch breaks for learning (videos, reading)
- Evenings: 3-hour coding blocks (7 PM - 10 PM)
- Weekends: Full days (8 AM - 6 PM with breaks)
- Sacrifice social activities for one month
- Tell friends/family you're unavailable until mid-November

### **Motivation Crashes:**

**"I feel like an imposter / everyone is better than me"**

- **Reality check:** Look at your GitHub commits. You've built working software.
- Compare yourself to yourself 6 months ago, not to senior engineers with 10 years
- Remember: Companies hire for potential + culture fit, not just current skills
- Imposter syndrome means you're aware of what you don't know—that's wisdom
- Read your "wins document" (keep one with every accomplishment)

**"I got rejected from 5 applications in a row"**

- **Expected:** 10-20 rejections per offer is normal for career changers
- Each rejection is data: Are you targeting wrong roles? Is your resume ATS-optimized?
- Ask for feedback: "Thank you for considering me. Could you share what skills I should develop?"
- Double down on portfolio: Every rejection should motivate another commit
- **Reframe:** "I'm not being rejected—I'm filtering for the right fit"

**"I'm exhausted and want to quit"**

- **Take 24 hours off** (not 3 days—momentum is precious)
- Do something physical: Skydiving, rock climbing, long walk
- Talk to someone who's made a career change successfully
- Revisit your "why": Why did you start this journey?
- Look at job postings for roles you're targeting—imagine yourself there
- **Remember:** The pain of discipline is temporary; regret is permanent

### **Career Fair Panic:**

**"I'm terrified of the career fair"**

- Practice with low-stakes conversations first (coffee shop, meetup)
- Bring a friend for moral support (they can wait outside)
- Start with less important companies (warm-up conversations)
- Remember: Recruiters WANT to find good candidates—you're helping them
- Worst case: You get practice for next time. Best case: You get an interview.
- **Reframe:** It's not an interrogation—it's a conversation between professionals

**"They asked me a technical question I couldn't answer"**

- **Perfect response:** "I haven't worked with that specifically, but here's how I'd approach it..."
- Relate to what you DO know: "I haven't used Kubernetes in production, but I've containerized apps with Docker and understand orchestration concepts"
- Show learning ability: "That's on my learning roadmap—can you recommend resources?"
- **Never lie:** "I don't know" + curiosity is better than bullshitting

## **FINAL WORDS: THE MINDSET THAT WINS**

This isn't about being the best coder in the room. It's about being the most **reliable**, **systematic**, and **growth-oriented** person they interview.

**When recruiters ask "Why should we hire you?", your answer is:**

> "Because I don't just write code—I build systems that work. I've spent a decade managing operations where failure wasn't an option. I've automated complex workflows, identified critical issues before they became expensive problems, and achieved top performance ratings in high-stakes environments.
> 
> Now I'm applying that same rigor to software. My Skydiving API isn't just a portfolio project—it's production-ready: 95% test coverage, CI/CD automation, Docker deployment, monitoring dashboards, and live on AWS. I don't cut corners.
> 
> You're not hiring a junior who needs constant supervision. You're hiring someone who shows up, figures things out, and delivers. I've proven that for 10 years. Now I'm doing it with code."

**Then show them your GitHub. Let the work speak.**

* * *

You have **30 days** to turn this plan into reality.

The calendar is clear. The path is mapped. The only variable is **execution**.

One month from now, you'll either be interviewing for technical roles with a portfolio that makes recruiters sit up straight—or you'll be making excuses about why you didn't have time.

The choice, as always, is yours.

**Now go build.**

What's the first task you're starting with tomorrow morning?
