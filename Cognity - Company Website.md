# Customer Relationship Management

Cognity specialises in demanding CRM project implementations, having experience in mission-critical projects in the leading Telecommunications, Banking, Insurance, Betting, Pharmaceutical and Consumer Goods customers in Europe and beyond. Cognity's experience is in Oracle Siebel CRM, Oracle Cloud Cx and Salesforce implementations.

CRM is a comprehensive approach to identifying, acquiring and retaining customers. By enabling organisations to manage and coordinate customer interactions across multiple channels, departments and lines of business, CRM helps in maximising the value of every customer interaction, achieve excellence in customer experience and drive superior business performance. Organisations can reap rewards from CRM in several ways such as:

- *Improving* and optimising *customer experience* across channels (Web, Mobile/Tablet, Contact Center, IVR, Shop/Branch, Partner, Email, Social Media, etc.)
    
- *Extending* the depth and breadth of *customer relationships*, to increase customer “wallet share” and market share
    
- Building *customer satisfaction* and *loyalty* in every customer interaction, across touchpoints
    
- Making it easy for customers to do business with the organisation anytime, anywhere, any way they prefer and making *customers feel that they are dealing with a same organisation*, that recognises them and their value at every contact
    
- *Reducing* delivery channel *costs* by moving customers and transactions from costly channels to less expensive ones, such as the Mobile/Tablet, the Web, the Contact Center/IVR
    
- *Harnessing* the influencing power of *Social Media* by listening to your Customers, analysing their behaviour and integrating their social media interactions with their 360-degree customer view.
    
- *Reinforcing* the organisation’s *brand* — not merely by raising awareness through indirect media, but by fulfilling the brand’s promise through direct media campaigns, real-time decisions (RTD) and next-best action (NBA).
    
- *Reinforcing* *dealer/partner relations* in order to support end-to-end customer-centric marketing, sales and service processes
    

By streamlining processes and providing sales, service and marketing employees with up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive customer information, CRM enables organisations to establish deeper and more profitable customer relationships, increase customer retention, improve employee productivity and decrease operating costs. More specifically:

- **Marketing** departments can improve campaign management and marketing planning, increase marketing-driven revenue and campaign response rates, while at the same time decreasing lead generation and customer acquisition costs.
    
- By employing the latest technologies in Real-Time Decision-making (**RTD**) and Next-Best-Action or Next-Best-Offer (**NBA/NBO**) they can engage in an actual dialogue with the customer, take into account the real-time context of the dialogue and optimise in real-time the propositions/offers to the customer.
    
- **Sales** departments can manage the opportunity sales cycle, improve cross-selling and up-selling, perform more accurate forecasting and increase key sales-performance metrics such as average order size, revenue per sales representative, revenue per customer, product penetration per customer, etc.
    
- **Customer Service/Customer Care** departments can increase service employee productivity, decrease handling time, improve resolution times and facilitate customer retention, while decreasing service costs and enhancing the complete customer view with customer-generated content.
    

Effective CRM is a strategic imperative for corporate growth and survival in a highly-competitive environment, across every industry sector. Customer Experience Management is of paramount importance to the overall customer satisfaction, while products are being commoditised. Research has shown that companies with satisfied/loyal customers have more repeat business, lower customer acquisition costs and stronger brand value, all of which translates into improved financial performance.

# Order Management for Retail

Order management is a critical component for retail businesses, ensuring streamlined operations and enhanced customer satisfaction. At its core, order management involves the efficient **tracking** and **handling** of **orders**, from the moment they are placed until they are delivered to the customer. This system provides a centralized platform for managing sales, inventory, and customer information, which is vital for retail businesses of all sizes. The adoption of an effective order management system can significantly improve accuracy in order fulfillment, reduce processing times, and minimize errors. This leads to a more reliable and swift service, essential for maintaining customer trust and loyalty.

Moreover, order management offers substantial benefits to retailers in terms of **inventory** **management** and **customer experience.** By providing real-time visibility into stock levels, it helps in maintaining optimal inventory, preventing overstocking or stockouts. This visibility enables retailers to make informed decisions about reordering and merchandising, thus reducing holding costs and maximizing sales opportunities. Additionally, a well-integrated order management system enhances the customer experience by providing timely updates on order status and facilitating easy returns and exchanges. In today’s fast-paced retail environment, offering such transparency and convenience is key to building lasting customer relationships and driving repeat business.

# Integration with WFM-Field Service

Integrating [Field Service (WFM)](https://www.cognity.gr/crm-cx) with Order Management in Telecoms or Energy & Utilities creates a seamless flow of operations from customer requests to service fulfillment. This integration enables real-time coordination between order processing and field technicians, ensuring accurate installation, repair, or maintenance services. For instance, when a customer places an order for a new connection or upgrade, the system automatically schedules and dispatches a technician with the necessary tools and information. This alignment reduces delays, minimises errors, and enhances customer satisfaction by delivering services on time and as promised. Additionally, it provides visibility into order status and service execution, fostering better communication and operational efficiency across departments.

# Customer Relationship Management

Cognity specialises in demanding CRM project implementations, having experience in mission-critical projects in the leading Telecommunications, Banking, Insurance, Betting, Pharmaceutical and Consumer Goods customers in Europe and beyond. Cognity's experience is in Oracle Siebel CRM, Oracle Cloud Cx and Salesforce implementations.

CRM is a comprehensive approach to identifying, acquiring and retaining customers. By enabling organisations to manage and coordinate customer interactions across multiple channels, departments and lines of business, CRM helps in maximising the value of every customer interaction, achieve excellence in customer experience and drive superior business performance. Organisations can reap rewards from CRM in several ways such as:

- *Improving* and optimising *customer experience* across channels (Web, Mobile/Tablet, Contact Center, IVR, Shop/Branch, Partner, Email, Social Media, etc.)
    
- *Extending* the depth and breadth of *customer relationships*, to increase customer “wallet share” and market share
    
- Building *customer satisfaction* and *loyalty* in every customer interaction, across touchpoints
    
- Making it easy for customers to do business with the organisation anytime, anywhere, any way they prefer and making *customers feel that they are dealing with a same organisation*, that recognises them and their value at every contact
    
- *Reducing* delivery channel *costs* by moving customers and transactions from costly channels to less expensive ones, such as the Mobile/Tablet, the Web, the Contact Center/IVR
    
- *Harnessing* the influencing power of *Social Media* by listening to your Customers, analysing their behaviour and integrating their social media interactions with their 360-degree customer view.
    
- *Reinforcing* the organisation’s *brand* — not merely by raising awareness through indirect media, but by fulfilling the brand’s promise through direct media campaigns, real-time decisions (RTD) and next-best action (NBA).
    
- *Reinforcing* *dealer/partner relations* in order to support end-to-end customer-centric marketing, sales and service processes
    

By streamlining processes and providing sales, service and marketing employees with up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive customer information, CRM enables organisations to establish deeper and more profitable customer relationships, increase customer retention, improve employee productivity and decrease operating costs. More specifically:

- **Marketing** departments can improve campaign management and marketing planning, increase marketing-driven revenue and campaign response rates, while at the same time decreasing lead generation and customer acquisition costs.
    
- By employing the latest technologies in Real-Time Decision-making (**RTD**) and Next-Best-Action or Next-Best-Offer (**NBA/NBO**) they can engage in an actual dialogue with the customer, take into account the real-time context of the dialogue and optimise in real-time the propositions/offers to the customer.
    
- **Sales** departments can manage the opportunity sales cycle, improve cross-selling and up-selling, perform more accurate forecasting and increase key sales-performance metrics such as average order size, revenue per sales representative, revenue per customer, product penetration per customer, etc.
    
- **Customer Service/Customer Care** departments can increase service employee productivity, decrease handling time, improve resolution times and facilitate customer retention, while decreasing service costs and enhancing the complete customer view with customer-generated content.
    

Effective CRM is a strategic imperative for corporate growth and survival in a highly-competitive environment, across every industry sector. Customer Experience Management is of paramount importance to the overall customer satisfaction, while products are being commoditised. Research has shown that companies with satisfied/loyal customers have more repeat business, lower customer acquisition costs and stronger brand value, all of which translates into improved financial performance.

# API Management = Part of a contemporary Digital Architecture

API Management is an essential part of contemporary Digital Architectures enabling the complete API publishing, lifecycle management, application development, access control and analytics. API Management solutions enable you to setup the connectivity, security and systems agility required to build a digital business that serves customer experience and scales according to your needs. API Management solutions enable you to

Cognity can help you implement an API Management strategy that will monitise your APIs and digitally transform your organisation.

# Microservices

Microservices have become a key component in modern digital architecture, revolutionising the way software applications are designed and developed. These lightweight, **loosely-coupled** services offer a range of features and benefits that make them highly attractive for businesses.

Firstly, microservices enable **modularisation**, allowing development teams to work on different components independently. This enhances agility and accelerates the delivery of new features.

Secondly, with microservices, applications can **scale** more **easily** and **efficiently**. Each service can be scaled individually depending on demand, resulting in improved performance and resource utilization.

Additionally, microservices promote fault **isolation**, as one service failure does not bring down the entire system. This makes troubleshooting and maintenance much easier.

Lastly, microservices enable the use of **diverse** **technology** stacks, as different services can be built with different programming languages and frameworks, facilitating flexibility and innovation.

Overall, the features and benefits of microservices empower businesses to build **robust**, **scalable**, and **adaptable** digital architectures that meet the evolving needs of the digital landscape.

# Low-Code & BPM as an enabler of Digital

BPM can also serve as the basis of all the digital processes of the organisation from Customer On-boarding and KYC, to Order Management and Customer Service. Globally leading BPM & Low-code vendors, enable organisations to implement their business processes and digitally transform, using low-code or no-code approaches.

# Service-Oriented Architecture & Enterprise Service Bus

A comprehensive Integration and Application platform, works together with your existing IT infrastructure to enable and manage change. With our Integration solutions, you can flexibly and rapidly design, build, implement and execute new business strategies and processes. You can also drive innovation throughout your organisation by combining existing systems, while maintaining a sustainable cost structure.

Organisations that effectively align technology with business goals achieve competitive advantage. We are helping organisations to achieve faster time-to-value by driving compatibility across the application infrastructure through open standards and service-oriented architecture (SOA).

SOA is an IT strategy that organises the discrete functions contained in enterprise applications into interoperable, standards-based services that can be combined and reused quickly to meet business needs. SOA enables a more adaptable IT environment and facilitates integration. In SOA, IT systems are developed as independent, loosely coupled business services. Each business service can be easily integrated or reused, creating a more flexible IT infrastructure with faster delivery cycles and lower costs. Through SOA, organisations can enable Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and they can integrate:

- **Information** - Provide an integrated, consistent, accurate, real-time view of your data, residing across disparate systems and platforms.
    
- **Processes** - Automate and comprehensively monitor your processes across applications, people and organisations
    
- **Applications** - Interconnect your applications using pre-built and configurable adapters
    
- **Channels** - Provide consistent information across all communication channels with your customers (Call Center, Sales Force, WWW, E-mail, Mobile/Tablet, ATM, etc.)
    
- **Business Partners** \- Extend your business processes and applications to partners using industry standard protocols
    

Key Components of a Service Oriented Architecture are the following:

- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
    
- BPEL
    
- Business Rules
    
- Complex Event Processing (CEP)
    
- B2B Integration
    
- SOA Governance
    
- Service Registry, Enterprise Repository
    
- Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)
    
- Unified Management & Monitoring
    
- Security
    

Today, organisations that have adopted service-oriented environments based on J2EE enterprise software foundation are experiencing improved results, including increased revenues, increased customer satisfaction, lower operational costs and higher returns on their existing technology investments. We embrace Internet standards such as HTTP, XML and Web services, ensuring openness and interoperability with J2EE, .net and other environments.

## SOA provides tangible benefits: Reusability, Productivity, Time-to-market, Channel Enablement, Reliability, Scalability, Resilience

By organising enterprise IT around services instead of around applications, SOA provides key benefits:

- Improves productivity, agility and speed for both Business and IT
    
- Allows IT to deliver services faster and align closer with business
    
- Allows the business to respond quicker and deliver optimal user experience
    
- Masks the underlying technical complexity of the IT environment
    

This results in more rapid development and more reliable delivery of new and enhanced business services.

# Application Integration Architecture (AIA)

> Pre-built integration and best-practice business processes for a fast and best-of-breed implementation

Oracle's Application Integration Architecture (AIA) offers prebuilt integration and business processes between Oracle's leading applications in CRM (Siebel), Order & Service Management (OSM), Billing (BRM), ERP (eBusiness Suite), etc. AIA delivers pre-built content, templates and methodologies for orchestrating agile user-centric business processes across enterprise applications. It enables best-in-class applications, Oracle and non-Oracle, to work together, leveraging industry best practices and open standards to reduce costs and increase business flexibility.

AIA provides open-standards-based, packaged solutions to help you jump-start integration efforts across all your applications of Oracle, third-party, or homegrown. Unlike point-to-point integrations that are not sustainable or reusable from one release to the next or as you replace applications, integrations done with AIA are configurable, extensible, and sustainable, allowing you to leverage both your existing and future applications investments.

AIA consists of a Foundation pack and Process Integration Packs (PIPs) like Order to Bill, Order to Activate, Agent Assisted Billing Care, etc.

- The **Foundation Pack** contains the building blocks and templates (process models, business objects, and business services) needed to integrate any combination of custom, Oracle, and non-Oracle applications into agile business processes. The Foundation pack components are standards-based and tailored to meet specific industry needs (e.g. Telecommunications). Together with the necessary toolkit and methodology, this pack helps bypass much of the ongoing cost and work associated with complex integration projects, offering an accelerated route to a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Incorporating the best practices from decades of integration expertise, a foundation pack is your do-it-yourself kit for building end-to-end, integrated business processes based on SOA. It consists of Reference Process Models, Enterprise Business Objects & Services, SOA Governance & Lifecycle Management Tools and a predefined Reference Architecture and Methodology.
    
- The **Process Integration Packs (PIPs)**. These are prebuilt, end-to-end business process integrations that connect specific Oracle and non-Oracle applications (such as SAP). Oracle uses Oracle Application Integration Architecture Foundation Pack to build each process integration pack. If a process integration pack is available for the applications you want to connect, you can readily use it to accelerate the initial integration tasks. Then you are ready to extend the integration to meet your specific business needs and context.

# Business Process Management

Business Process Management (BPM) is a natural extension layer of a SOA, since it enables business users to design the business processes of the organisation by using building blocks from the underlying SOA layers. This enables rapid process design, implementation, testing and execution, while it provides maximum flexibility to the organisation to change its business processes and adapt to the changing environment.

Business processes are at the heart of the enterprise and are the basis of differentiation for the organisations. In times of growth or in times of crisis, improving business processes remains a high business priority as the impact of greater efficiency, business visibility, and agility helps organisations adapt to change.

However, business processes are often a model of inefficiency. Social, organizational, and technical barriers prevent processes from being managed efficiently. Excessive manual effort and error prone re-entry of data introduces greater complexity and cost. An urgent change in business or regulation requires timely process change at any cost. Collaboration across organizational silos is minimal at best.  Improving processes requires managing change effectively and too often these barriers become the obstacles that prevent change.

Leading organisations manage and optimise business processes that improve efficiency, increase margins, improve customer satisfaction, provide visibility into market risk, and improve operational excellence, by adopting BPM technologies.

**Data Governance • Quality • Compliance**

Data is your most valuable Asset

# Data Governance • Metadata Management • Compliance

By using our open and extensible metadata platform, organisations are solving tough information management and operational issues in the areas of: Data Governance, GDPR, Regulatory Compliance, Small and Big Data integration, Business Intelligence Reporting, Data Privacy and Protection and Data Quality initiatives.

Organizations who need to answer the following information management questions with confidence and speed are using the Metadata Management solution:

- Who is using the data?
- Which data elements are used where?
- What is the quality of the data?
- What is the definition of an entity or attribute?
- What processes use a specific object?
- What applications will be impacted if my customer data “source” changes?
- Which business functions are supported by this customer data?  
- Which data elements are in compliance with industry standards?

The **Metadata Management solution is the cornerstone of your organisation's GDPR, Regulatory Compliance and Data Governance**.

The solution can be deployed on-premise or in a secure, managed hosting environment in the following ways:

Setup the core platform (repository and management capabilities). Extend its value through adding ‘data bridges’ that enable seamless metadata import from a wide variety of sources. Determine the number of end users, and their access levels (to secure the right amount of client access licenses) as well as the number of ‘workspace designers’ (requiring designer licenses) who will configure and enhance Views, Dashboards and Analytic services. Consulting and Engineering services, from Cognity and Adaptive, are ready to bring your implementation alive, from the basics through to advanced metadata and metamodel integration.

# Data Quality

Data Quality solutions are critical components in successful data integration, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Business Intelligence (BI), Analytics, Data Warehouse (DW), Business Performance Management, Compliance and Big Data projects. We can provide you with a comprehensive set of solutions for greater global information integrity, wherever and however data is captured, collected, stored and manipulated within the enterprise.

Our solutions fully support the complete lifecycle of data management that includes data assessment and profiling, data standardisation, information enrichment, data linking and perpetual data quality monitoring. In each phase of this lifecycle, raw, inconsistent and chaotic data become more valuable and usable information that business users can trust and managers can use to optimise business performance.

Designed for diverse enterprise environments and technology architectures, the scalable and modular components of the solution for global data quality and data profiling can be ported across diverse systems, integrated with enterprise applications, iteratively tuned for consistent results and globally enabled for business without borders.

Maintaining high data quality in this environment requires the ability to understand and improve data quality during integration and migration projects, within real-time transactions and for third-party data feeds. We provide a Universal Architecture which answers these challenges with a scalable, flexible framework that supports the integration of data quality processes into any system, at any time, anywhere in the world. From tactical projects to strategic practices, the Universal Architecture increases integration efficiency, lowers development costs, and provides faster return on investment (ROI) from data quality initiatives through:

- Modular software design - It comprises of self-contained, linked modules that you can configure and arrange to meet unique business needs. The ability to call any Total Data Quality process-Discovery, Standardisation, Cleansing, Enrichment, or Linking- individually from an application or from another data quality process lets you integrate only the data quality processes you need, when you need them, in the order you want them
- Universal connectivity components - It includes an Integration Layer that streamlines your ability to incorporate data quality processes into any data flow. The components offered are Web Services (WS), connectors to ERP and CRM Systems, ETL Tools, EJBs, APIs for calling the DQ processes from Java, C/C++/C#, VB/VB.net, RPG and COBOL
- Architecture-neutral core technology - It protects your ability to integrate data quality processes across even the most complex IT environments-in both batch and real-time business processes
- Portable, reusable resources and tunable processes - The non-proprietary text format of the resource files, such as business rules, directories, and parameters, facilitates near-instantaneous replication and portability across practically any platform or system. In addition, multiple implementations can refer to a single, centralized set of resources. Both methods let you leverage efforts from one implementation across new projects and the entire enterprise, dramatically reducing costs in multiple implementations and allowing you to easily create, propagate, and maintain an enterprise data quality standard
- Expandable, global support - Wherever your market evolves, we can support your business. Offering geographic data validation and cleansing for every country in the world and the most robust available support for more than 30 major global markets, we let you easily add country-specific data quality processes to meet new data management needs. We offer Unicode and double-byte character support, along with support for more than 30 common code pages; automatic recognition and routing of commingled country data.

  Operational Customer and Product Master, ensuring Centralised Management and Distribution

# Master Data Management

The two main areas of Master Data Management (MDM) cover **Customer Data** **Integration** (CDI or Customer Master, Customer Hub) and **Product Master** (or Product Hub) and they create operational sources of Customer and Product information, respectively, that play a central role in modern IT Architectures. These systems consolidate and integrate data from various back-end systems and enable the organisation to provide a single source of truth for Customer and Product related data.

The Enterprise Master Data Management (MDM) suite of products consolidates and maintains complete, accurate, and authoritative master data across the enterprise and distributes this master information to all operational and analytical applications as a shared service.

Cognity has implemented some of the most complex and demanding MDM projects in Southeast Europe in large Telecommunications and Financial Services organisations, consolidating data from disparate back-end systems, enforcing common Data Quality policies and rules, and integrating the MDM with the back-end systems over SOA, in order to ensure the consistent and real-time flow of information.

In addition to the above, [Data Quality & Data Governance](https://www.cognity.gr/data-quality-governance-compliance) play an integral part of an the overall MDM project, enabling the organisation to cleanse, transform, de-duplicate and standardise its Customer and Product data.

# IT Service Management

All revenue channels are supported by Services. If they do not work efficiently, organisations lose money and customers. Cognity's ITSM solutions empower our customers to successfully Control & Manage all the elements of the IT delivery chain, by effectively mapping and monitoring the Infrastructure, Applications and Services related to each line of Business. This enables the proactive and real-time detection of issues -accurate zero-in on root causes or underlying problems- resulting in their resolution before the end-user experience is negatively impacted.

We design, implement and support enterprise scalable, customer-specific solutions through the following Professional Services.

## Management of IT Infrastructure

## Configuration Management

Your IT environment is complex and distributed. This makes it critical to understand how changes to your environment impact services that run your Business. You need visibility into infrastructure and applications to understand how they support your business services.

Universal Configuration Management Database (uCMDB) software verifies the relationships between infrastructure, applications and business services. Universal CMDB software automatically maintains accurate, up-to-date information on these relationships. One of Universal CMDB's key differentiators is its native integration with HP Discovery and Dependency Mapping software.

Discovery and Dependency Mapping (DDMA) software automates discovery and dependency mapping of services, applications, and underlying infrastructure. Mapping helps you perform failure impact analysis, which minimise downtime. Improved visibility into IT helps you transform into a modern, flexible, and converged infrastructure that reduces operational expense, defers capital expense, and improves business uptime. 80% of all service disruptions are caused by faulty changes, and DDMA provides the visibility required for more effective changes.
